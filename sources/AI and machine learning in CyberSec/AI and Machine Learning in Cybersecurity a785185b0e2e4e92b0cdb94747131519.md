## Types of AI and Machine Learning

AI plays a pivotal role in cybersecurity so understanding the different types of AI and Machine Learning used in this domain is crucial. This section covers several fundamental types of AI and ML employed in cybersecurity: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These types encompass a range of techniques and methodologies that empower cybersecurity systems to detect, analyze, and respond to threats with increased accuracy and efficiency.

### **Supervised Machine Learning**

Supervised machine learning involves collecting pre-categorized websites (training labels) along with the corresponding html and images for those websites (training features). We then “train” a model to create a mapping from the large number of features to the labels. Feedback is provided to the supervised model in the form of a loss function, where the model is penalized for incorrect answers and rewarded for correct answers. In this way, the machine learning algorithm slowly gets better as more and more labeled data enters the model.

### **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

On the other hand, unsupervised learning involves using only the training features WITHOUT labels to determine useful trends and “clusters” in the data. This method can work well if you have lots and lots of data and need a place to start; however, models will be much less accurate. And yes, it is exhaustive work to analyze and label the amount of websites that is required to achieve a state-of-the-art model.

### **Human Supervised Machine Learning (HS/ML)**

Machine Learning must constantly evaluate models against humans and vice versa to make sure that they are always up to date and accurate. In HS/ML, when a human finds that the algorithm has made a mistake, the data is automatically incorporated back into the system so that the model in question can be retrained to avoid such mistakes in the future. Constant monitoring, flagging, and retraining process is key to building a high degree of accuracy to minimize false positives that can plague many security tools.

### **Deep Learning**

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning methods based on how the human brain is structured to process information. The objective of deep learning algorithms is to deduce comparable insights to those of humans through continuous analysis of data using a predetermined logical framework. To accomplish this, deep learning employs complex arrangements of algorithms referred to as neural networks which are capable of learning complex patterns and representations from data. Deep learning is increasingly being applied to cybersecurity to enhance threat detection, network security, and data protection.

### **Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a distinct learning paradigm within machine learning that focuses on decision-making in dynamic environments and draws inspiration from how humans learn through trial and error. This approach involves training an AI system to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize a reward or minimize a penalty. In the context of cybersecurity, reinforcement learning can be applied to various scenarios, such as adaptive threat response and dynamic policy enforcement.

By continuously interacting with the environment, the AI system learns optimal strategies and adapts its behavior based on the observed outcomes, enabling it to effectively identify and respond to emerging threats in real-time. RL can be applied to cybersecurity to enhance security measures and decision-making processes. Use case examples include adaptive intrusion detection, automated response and mitigation systems, threat hunting, resource allocation and optimization, and vulnerability assessment and patching.

### **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback**

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a specific form of reinforcement learning that incorporates human feedback into the learning process. In addition to interacting with the environment, the agent also receives guidance or feedback from a human expert in the form of explicit reward signals, demonstrations, or evaluations. Integrating human knowledge into reinforcement learning, helps to improve learning efficiency and achieve better performance. It is often used in applications where human expertise or preferences are valuable.

**It should be noted that human expertise and oversight to provide feedback on detected threats, validate suspicious activities, or provide domain-specific knowledge, is paramount to refining the RL models and policies which ensure the proper functioning and security of RL systems.**

### **Natural Language Processing**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area within Artificial Intelligence that is specifically focused on interactions between machines and humans, using software that can interact with human language to extract details like sentiment, named people or places, intent, topics, etc. NLP is leveraged for malicious detection to analyze large volumes of data and detect patterns that can be missed by using traditional security tools. The NLP algorithms analyze the language used in email communications, in website content or on social media platforms to look for signs of malicious activity — like botnets, spam, fake accounts, etc. — to identify patterns and trends that may indicate emerging threats or new attack vectors.

### **Neural Machine Translation**

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a subfield of NLP that focuses on using artificial neural networks to translate text from one language to another. As the threat landscape is not bound by language or geographical regions, the use of NMT to analyze and translate large volumes of data into multiple languages is critical to malicious detection. Security analysts can leverage NMT to translate communications between attackers, website content, social media posts and other digital content to identify patterns in language that may be indicative of malicious activity.
