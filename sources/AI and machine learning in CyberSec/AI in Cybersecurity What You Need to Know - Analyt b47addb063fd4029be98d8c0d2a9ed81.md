## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity protects internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. The importance of cybersecurity has grown in recent years as more and more of our daily activities and important information are stored and transmitted online.

Cybersecurity threats exist, including hacking, malware, phishing, and ransomware. Hacking refers to unauthorized access to a computer system or network. Malware is software specifically designed to harm or exploit a computer or network. Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Ransomware is malware that encrypts a victim’s files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.

It is important for individuals, businesses, and governments. Individuals must protect personal information such as financial data, identification numbers, and login credentials from cyber criminals. For businesses, it is important to protect sensitive business information and ensure continuity of operations in case of a cyber attack. Cybersecurity is also critical for government and military operations, as a cyber attack on their systems can severely affect national security.

## Traditional Approach to Cybersecurity Before AI

Before AI, cybersecurity largely relied on traditional approaches. Organizations employed rule-based systems and signature-based detection methods to identify known threats like viruses and malware. These methods were limited in handling evolving and sophisticated cyber threats. Human analysts manually reviewed logs and data, often leading to delayed responses and missed vulnerabilities. The lack of automation and real-time analysis made it challenging to counter rapidly changing attack techniques. Additionally, the inability to handle vast amounts of data hindered effective threat detection and response. As cyber threats became more complex, the traditional approach struggled to keep up, underscoring the need for a more dynamic and proactive solution.

## How AI is Different From Traditional Approaches to Cybersecurity?

AI brings a paradigm shift in cybersecurity, distinct from traditional approaches. Here’s how AI differs from conventional methods:

### Proactive Detection

AI employs machine learning algorithms to analyze vast datasets and detect subtle anomalies, including previously unknown threats, whereas traditional methods mainly rely on predefined signatures or rules.

### Adaptive Learning

AI systems continuously learn from new data, adapting to evolving attack patterns and staying ahead of attackers. In contrast, traditional approaches may need help to keep up with rapidly changing tactics.

### Behavioral Analysis

AI observes user and system behavior, detecting deviations from established norms. Using rule-based systems, this behavioral analysis identifies unusual activities that may not trigger alerts.

### Pattern Recognition

AI excels at recognizing complex attack patterns across diverse data sources, even when attackers disguise their actions. Traditional methods might miss such disguised threats.

### Reduced False Positives

AI’s self-learning capability enables it to reduce false positives by refining its understanding of what constitutes normal behavior, leading to more accurate threat detection.

### Real-Time Response

AI automates real-time threat response by instantly flagging and neutralizing suspicious activities. Traditional methods may require manual intervention, leading to slower responses.

### Threat Hunting

AI-driven analytics enable proactive threat hunting, actively seeking out hidden threats and vulnerabilities within the system, which traditional methods often overlook.

### Prediction and Prevention

AI forecasts potential threats based on historical and real-time data, enabling organizations to implement preventive measures. Traditional methods are more reactive.

### Scalability

AI scales effortlessly to analyze massive amounts of data, which is ideal for the high-volume environments of modern cybersecurity. Traditional approaches may struggle with such scalability.

### Learning from Experience

AI models learn from past incidents and improve over time, becoming more effective with each iteration. Traditional methods rely on the expertise of human analysts without the same learning curve.

### Complexity Handling

AI can handle complex and multifaceted attack strategies, including polymorphic malware and advanced persistent threats, which can evade traditional defenses.

### Minimized Human Bias

AI-based decisions are devoid of human bias, providing impartial and consistent threat assessment, whereas traditional approaches might be influenced by human judgments.

## Application of AI in Cybersecurity

Here is a few potential application of AI and Machine Learning in Cybersecurity:

### Using ML For Malware Detection and Classification

AI in cybersecurity contributes to [detecting and classifying malware](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/01/microsoft-malware-detection/). [Machine learning algorithms](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/common-machine-learning-algorithms/) can be trained to recognize the characteristics of different types of malware, such as viruses, worms, and trojans. This enables the system to detect and classify new malware in real-time, even if it has not been previously seen.

### AI-based Network Traffic Analysis and Anomaly Detection

AI and ML are also used in network traffic analysis and [anomaly detection](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/01/impact-of-categorical-encodings-on-anomaly-detection-methods/). These systems use machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies, which may indicate a potential intrusion. For example, a system can use ML to detect a sudden increase in traffic from a specific IP address or to identify network activity patterns indicative of a particular type of attack.

### AI-assisted Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Management

Penetration testing and vulnerability management are also areas where AI and ML are used. Penetration testing is the process of attempting to gain unauthorized access to a system or network. At the same time, vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, and mitigating vulnerabilities in a system or network. [Machine learning algorithms](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/07/machine-learning-aided-differentiation-of-real-and-fake-news/) can be used to automate both of these processes, making them more efficient and effective.

AI-powered security automation and orchestration is another area where AI and ML are used. These systems use machine learning algorithms to automate repetitive security tasks, such as patch management and incident response. This enables organizations to free up human resources and focus on more important tasks.

### AI-based User and Entity Behavior Analytics

AI-based user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) is another area in which AI and ML are used in cybersecurity. These systems use machine learning algorithms to analyze the behavior of users and entities on a network. This enables organizations to detect anomalies and identify potential threats, such as insider threats and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### AI-Powered Cyber Threat Hunting

AI-powered [cyber threat hunting](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/industry-insight-fighting-cyber-fraud-with-analytics/) is an emerging application of AI and ML in cybersecurity that aims to detect and respond to advanced threats that have evaded traditional security systems. The goal of threat hunting is to identify and stop malicious actors before they can cause damage to an organization.
