## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI as part of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family of AI models.

Designed to generate normal responses to language prompts, ChatGPT uses its deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text and responds to complex questions in a conversational manner.

Using a dataset of over 45 terabytes of text data from the internet and a combination of learning techniques, OpenAI trained ChatGPT to generate natural-sounding responses. Since then, OpenAI has continued to refine the model, releasing subsequent versions that have increased ChatGPT’s capabilities.

Users simply “chat” with ChatGPT. ChatGPT can be used in various ways, including as a language model for chatbots, a tool for generating text-based content such as articles or news stories, and a research tool.

While the public reaction to ChatGPT has been generally positive, many IT and cyber professionals are concerned about security, since ChatGPT can be used to generate fake news or impersonate people online.

In response, OpenAI has deployed various measures to promote responsible use of ChatGPT, but online hackers are taking advantage of ChatGPT’s popularity to prey upon unsuspecting users.

Scammers use various tactics to impersonate ChatGPT and trick users into revealing personal and business account information and financial information.

One common scammer tactic is to create fake ChatGPT accounts or chatbots on various online platforms, such as social media sites or messaging apps. Hackers then reach out to users, offering them the services of ChatGPT.

Cyber criminals also use ChatGPT by suggesting that it can help improve business operations, provide financial advice, or even offer a loan. Once the scammer has gained the user’s trust, they will ask the user to provide personal or business account information, such as login credentials or bank account details.

They may also ask for financial information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, under the guise of needing it to verify the user’s identity. In reality, the scammer uses this information to gain unauthorized access to the user’s accounts and steal money or sensitive data.

## How to Defend Against ChatGPT Scams

Individuals and organizations can protect themselves from these types of scams by using caution when sharing personal information online.

Two ways to do this are by verifying the authenticity of a ChatGPT account or chatbot before providing sensitive information and by verifying the legitimacy of any service or platform a scammer directs them to before making any payments.

Cyber criminals use [phishing emails or messages](https://www.terranovasecurity.com/blog/top-examples-of-phishing-emails) to contact an individual to request sensitive personal information. A scammer can use ChatGPT to provide a link that will lead to a request for information, but any information shared will go directly to the cyber criminal behind the scheme.
