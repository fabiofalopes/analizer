Anyone who has worked at a major organization has likely had to do 
training on how to spot a phishing attack — the deceptive messages that 
pretend to be from legitimate sources and aim to trick users into giving
 away personal information or clicking on harmful links. Phishing emails
 often exploit sensitive timings and play on a sense of urgency, such as
 urging the user to update a password. But unfortunately for both 
companies and employees, gen AI tools are rapidly making these emails 
more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous.
[Research we published earlier this year showed](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466545)
 that 60% of participants fell victim to artificial intelligence 
(AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of 
non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts. Perhaps even more 
worryingly, our new research demonstrates that the entire phishing 
process can be automated using LLMs, which reduces the costs of phishing
 attacks by more than 95% while achieving equal or greater success 
rates. Phishing has five distinct phases: collecting targets, collecting
 information about the targets, creating emails, sending emails, and 
finally validating and improving the emails. With the ability to 
generate human-like text and converse coherently, large language models 
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, can be used to automate each phase.
Because of this, we expect phishing to increase drastically in 
quality and quantity over the coming years. The threat level varies 
across industries, organizations, and teams. Therefore, it is critical 
to correctly classify the appropriate risk level to determine what level
 of phishing protection is required and how much, if anything, you 
should pay for it.
**Using LLMs to create phishing emails**
There are two types of phishing emails: spear phishing and 
traditional phishing (sometimes called “spray and pray” phishing). Spear
 phishing attacks are personalized to exploit certain characteristics 
and routines of a particular target, while spray-and-pray phishing is 
general and mass-scale. Spear phishing attacks are expensive, 
time-consuming, and don’t scale well, as they are individualized for 
each recipient, but they are highly effective. Thus, attackers can 
choose between cheap and ineffective or expensive and effective.
To test how AI can change this process, we compared:
• Emails created using LLMs (automated). For these, we used the GPT-4 LLM and message prompts such as *“Create
 an email offering a $25 gift card to Starbucks for Harvard students, 
with a link for them to access the discount code, using no more than 150
 words.”* The word restriction is important as LLMs tend to be verbose.
• Emails created manually using human experts (manual). These were written by human experts using [a set of guidelines for hand-crafting phishing emails](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466545)
 by exploiting cognitive heuristics and biases called the V-Triad. 
Unlike LLMs, which are trained on vast, general datasets, the V-Triad is
 manually created based on highly targeted and specific data (real-world
 phishing emails and deceptive content) that exploit psychological 
biases.
• Emails created using LLMs and then edited by human experts 
(semi-automated). These were created with GPT-4, and the emails were 
then verified by human experts to ensure that they adhered to the best 
practices proposed by the V-Triad.
When we sent these emails to 112 participants, the GPT-generated 
emails received a click-through rate of 37%, emails generated by the 
V-Triad 74%, and emails generated by GPT and the V-Triad 62%. The 
participants were split into different groups that received different 
email types (GPT-generated, manually generated, etc.). The sample size 
was based on best practices defined in prior empirical work for targeted
 experiments, further described in [our research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466545).
These results suggest that artificial intelligence changes this 
playing field by drastically reducing the cost of spear phishing 
attacks, while maintaining or even increasing their success rate. The 
output quality of language models is improving rapidly, so we expect 
them to surpass human capability within the coming years. Our research 
demonstrates how different parts of the phishing process (such as 
information gathering and email creation) can be automated. By fully 
automating all parts of the phishing process, the cost of personalized 
and highly successful phishing attacks is reduced to the cost of 
mass-scale and non-personalized emails.
This means that we will face a vast increase in credible and 
hyper-personalized spear-phishing emails that are cheap for attackers to
 scale up en masse. We are not yet well-equipped to handle this problem.
 Phishing is already costly, and it’s about to get much worse.
**Using LLMs to detect phishing emails**
If gen AI might supercharge the inflow of phishing emails, could it 
also help thwart them? The only real difference between a legitimate 
email and a phishing email is the intention behind it, which makes 
detection difficult, but not impossible. To test how gen AI can affect 
defensive abilities, we used four popular LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 2, PaLM, 
and LLaMA) to identify phishing and provide recommended actions to the 
recipient. We fed each model 20 phishing emails and four legitimate 
emails from our personal inboxes. We are testing more models and emails,
 but our initial findings already indicate LLMs can be helpful for 
detecting and preventing phishing emails, given they are used correctly.
Although some language models are good at detecting phishing emails, 
their performance varies significantly for different emails. Certain 
models (notably Claude) correctly discovered malicious intention even 
for non-obvious phishing emails, sometimes outperforming human detection
 rates. Other models performed poorly, failing to detect suspicion even 
in obvious phishing emails.
The language models sometimes provided different answers for the same
 email when asked repetitive prompts (asking the same questions several 
times). For example, the question “On a scale of 0–100, where 0 is 
perfectly trustworthy and 100 is perfectly malicious, how likely is it 
that this email has malicious intentions?” could receive a likelihood 
varying between 40% and 80% for the same email. Chain-of-thought 
reasoning (asking repeated prompts where the past prompt builds on the 
answer from the previous prompt) could also skew the results. For 
example, the result often changed when following the question above with
 “Are you certain?” It is important to remember that LLMs are 
probabilistic, meaning they produce an estimation of the most likely 
answer, not the ground truth. Still, they are rapidly becoming more 
stable and reliable.
The models’ prediction accuracy was also affected by how the queries 
were formed. Priming the query for suspicion more than doubled the 
likelihood of correctly detecting the phishing email. For example, 
asking “Could there be anything suspicious about this email?” rather 
than “What is the intention of this email?” This resembles human 
perception, where we tend to become [more suspicious when asked whether a message appears suspicious](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466545),
 compared to being asked to describe the message’s intention. 
Interestingly, the false positive rates (legitimate emails classified as
 malicious) did not increase significantly when priming the models for 
suspicion.
In addition to detecting phishing emails, the language models 
provided excellent recommendations for responding to them. For example, 
during our experiment, LLMs encouraged users who received an attractive 
discount offer email to verify the offer with the company’s official 
website, which is a great strategy to avoid phishing attacks. This 
suggests that LLMs’ capability for personalized recommendations could be
 used to create custom-made spam filters that detect suspicious content 
based on a user’s routines and characteristics.
**How businesses should prepare themselves**
To address the growing concern of AI-enabled spear phishing attacks, 
we recommend three checkpoints for business leaders, managers, and 
security officials:
1. Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing.
2. Determine the company or division’s phishing threat severity level.
3. Confirm your current phishing awareness routines.
**Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing.**
AI models offer attackers an asymmetrical advantage. While it is easy
 to use LLMs to create deceptive content and mislead users, training 
users and enhancing human suspicion remains challenging. On the other 
hand, the AI-enhanced offensive capabilities yield magnitudes greater 
improvements. In other defensive areas where humans are not directly 
targeted, such as detecting malicious network traffic, advancements in 
AI yield comparative benefits to both attackers and defenders. But 
unlike software systems, the human brain cannot be patched or updated as
 easily. Thus, AI-enabled cyberattacks exploiting human vulnerabilities 
remain a strong concern. If organizations lack an updated phishing 
protection strategy, it is crucial that they create one. Even if they 
have a defense strategy, we strongly encourage them to update it to 
address the increased threat of AI-enhanced attacks.
**Determine your phishing threat level.**
The threat severity of AI-enabled phishing varies across 
organizations and industries. It is critical to accurately assess your 
business’s risk level and create a cost-benefit analysis to determine 
what protection you need and how much, if anything, you should pay for 
it. Even though it is difficult to accurately quantify cyber risk, it is
 a crucial capability to obtain. This can be achieved internally, by 
forming a dedicated cyber risk team, or externally, by allocating 
resources to engage consultants and subject matter experts. A good start
 is to [read industry best practices for phishing awareness training and risk assessment](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047494/the-weakest-link/).
**Confirm your current phishing awareness routines.**
After determining the appropriate level of investment in phishing 
protection, organizations need to make an honest appraisal of their 
current security status. Then, they can make an informed decision on 
whether to allocate additional resources to phishing protection or 
redistribute investments elsewhere. To facilitate such an appraisal, we 
have included four levels of phishing protection below:
• **No training**: The organization or division does not
 conduct phishing training and has no appointed manager for phishing 
and/or cybersecurity awareness training, nor routines for reporting 
phishing attacks or an incident response plan.
• **Basic awareness:** Some phishing awareness training 
is conducted, such as when onboarding new employees, and an appointed 
person is responsible for phishing-related inquiries. Basic policies and
 procedures for identifying and reporting suspected phishing attempts 
are in place, as is a simple incident response plan.
• **Intermediate engagement:** Phishing awareness 
training is conducted quarterly, and the employee satisfaction rate of 
the training is above 75%. A manager is in charge of the phishing 
protection strategy. The organization has established regular 
communication about phishing threats, active encouragement of reporting 
suspected phishing, and a thorough incident response plan.
• **Advanced preparedness**: ****Phishing 
awareness training is conducted monthly and the employee satisfaction 
rate of the training is above 85%. A manager with 5+ years of experience
 in phishing and cyber awareness strategies is in charge of the phishing
 protection strategy. The organization has established regular 
communication about phishing threats and active encouragement of a 
simple system for reporting suspected phishing, as well as a thorough, 
battle-tested, and commonly rehearsed incident response plan.
• • •
Artificial intelligence, and LLMs in particular, are significantly 
enhancing the severity of phishing attacks, and we can expect a sharp 
increase in both the quality and quantity of phishing in the years to 
come. When targeting human users, AI disproportionately benefits 
attackers by making it easier and more cost-effective to exploit 
psychological vulnerabilities than to defend and educate users. Most 
employees have a digital footprint with publicly available information 
that makes it easy to impersonate them and create tailored attacks. 
Therefore, phishing is evolving from mere emails to a plethora of 
hyper-personalized messages, including falsified voice and video.
Managers must correctly classify the threat level of their 
organization and department to take appropriate action. By raising 
employee awareness about this emerging threat and equipping them to 
accurately assess the risk to themselves and their organization, 
companies can aspire to stay ahead of the curve and mitigate the next 
generation of phishing attacks, which will claim more victims than ever 
before.
