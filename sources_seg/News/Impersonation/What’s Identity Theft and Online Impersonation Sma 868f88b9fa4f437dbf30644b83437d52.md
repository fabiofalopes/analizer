In the digital age, where information flows freely and connections are made with just a click, the specter of **identity theft** and **impersonation** looms larger than ever before.

What once was a clumsy attempt at deception through collages or photoshop, has evolved into a sophisticated art of deceit, **powered by artificial intelligence (AI)** and **perpetuated through social media platforms** like Instagram, Facebook, and beyond.

In this article we will delve into this new way of cybercrime, its nefast impact and most importantly how to stand up to it.

## **Deepfakes -** cybercriminals new favorite thing

Advancements in technology have transformed the landscape of cybercrime, giving rise to new and sophisticated forms of identity theft and impersonation. With the help of AI-powered tools like Sora and others, **cybercriminals now have the ability to create hyper-realistic deepfake videos**, blurring the lines between reality and deception. These **deepfakes are used to trick unsuspecting individuals into believing they are interacting with authentic content**, opening the door to a host of malicious activities.

One recent example of this evolution is the case involving renowned personalities like the founder of Inditex group, Amancio Ortega. In this instance, a manipulated video featuring prominent figures such as Ana Blanco, former news presenter for Spanish Television, and Pablo Hernández de Cos, Governor of the Bank of Spain, circulated on social media. The video falsely claimed that Ortega was endorsing an investment project promising unrealistic returns, leading to widespread confusion and potential financial harm for unsuspecting viewers.

But this is only one drop in the ocean, for almost every day we now hear of a new deepfake involving a politician, an actor, a musician or even a neighbor.

And what's more? These cybercriminals make use of trendy topics and up-to-date information such as the **growing rise of Bitcoin** and link it to relevant brands or personalities in order to attract an even larger audience.

## **What is Identity Theft and Online Impersonation?**

Before we go any further, let’s get concepts straight:

- **Identity theft**: usually involves the unauthorized use of someone else's personal information for financial gain. This can include stealing sensitive data such as Social Security numbers, credit card details, or other identifying information to commit fraud. The consequences of identity theft can be severe, ranging from financial loss to damage to credit and emotional distress for the victim.
- **Impersonation**: generally, consists of pretending to be someone else in order to deceive others. This can take various forms, including creating [fake social media profiles](https://www.smartprotection.com/articles/how-to-report-a-fake-instagram-account), [websites](https://www.smartprotection.com/articles/the-rogues-gallery-understanding-cybersquatting-typosquatting-and-more), or email accounts to impersonate individuals, businesses, or organizations. Impersonation can be used for fraudulent purposes, such as scamming people out of money, spreading misinformation, or engaging in malicious activities like cyberbullying or defamation. And of course, it can be used for identity theft.

While these are distinct concepts, they often intersect in cases involving deepfake technology. In instances where someone's likeness or voice is used without her consent to create fake digital content and trick an audience, both identity theft and impersonation are at play. This convergence underscores the complexity of modern cybercrime and the need for [social media](https://www.smartprotection.com/en/social-networks) and [domain protection](https://www.smartprotection.com/en/fake-website-removal-and-domain-protection) as ways to combat these threats.

## **Most common types of identity theft and impersonation**

Identity theft and impersonation online can manifest in various forms, including:

- fake social media profiles: using stolen or fabricated identities, to impersonate individuals or organizations.
- phishing emails: used to trick recipients into providing personal information or clicking on malicious links.
- spoofed websites: fake websites used to steal users' login credentials or financial information.
- scam ads: designed to defraud individuals or promote [counterfeit goods](https://www.smartprotection.com/articles/what-you-should-know-about-brand-abuse-and-online-counterfeiting-if-you-own-an-e-commerce-site) or services.
- tech support scams: pretend to be reputable companies to convince victims to provide remote access to their computers or pay for unnecessary services.
- business email compromise: used to trick employees or business partners into transferring money or sensitive information.
- fake customer support accounts: created on social media to deceive customers into providing personal information or login credentials.
- celebrity impersonations: to gain followers or scam fans.
- fabricated product or service reviews: used to manipulate consumer perception.

## **The *Internet of Things* applicable to online scams**

All the aforementioned online risks are somewhat connected and have one common denominator: **the internet,** ...**and the vast amount of personal information readily available on it**.

Scammers exploit this wealth of data to create deceptive facades, such as fake social media profiles, counterfeit ads, and fake websites. Armed with just a few details gleaned from public profiles or data breaches, perpetrators can craft convincing personas or entities, to deceive unsuspecting individuals. This **stolen information is then leveraged across various platforms and schemes**.

A single piece of stolen data, such as a name or email address, can serve as a linchpin for a ton of fraudulent activities, from phishing scams to fake support accounts and fabricated product reviews.

Thus, the interconnected nature of these tactics underscores the importance of safeguarding personal information online and remaining vigilant against the ever-evolving threats of cybercrime.

## Consequences to businesses: The hidden costs on digital traffic

Beyond the direct harm inflicted on individuals and brands, identity theft and impersonation also hurt the digital ecosystem: **traffic driven by fraudulent ads and infringing content** not only turns resources away from legitimate sources but also undermines the integrity of online platforms. Moreover, it erodes consumer confidence in digital marketing, leading to decreased engagement and trust.

A significant issue that brands are currently facing revolves around the widespread use of scam ads to drive traffic to phishing pages. With this method (phishing), cybercriminals are no longer targeting companies' employees, but are instead aiming to attack their customers.

When thinking of businesses, the challenges posed extend beyond immediate financial losses and [reputational damage](https://www.smartprotection.com/articles/brand-reputation-crisis-how-to-manage-a-catastrophe-online). Here's a deeper look at the challenges they face:

1. **Financial losses**: Fraudulent advertisements and impersonation schemes can divert traffic and potential customers away from legitimate businesses. This loss of revenue directly impacts the bottom line, as businesses invest resources in advertising campaigns and marketing strategies that fail to yield returns due to competition from deceptive practices.
2. **Reputational damage**: Businesses spend years building their brands and fostering trust with consumers. However, when their identities are hijacked or associated with fraudulent schemes, it tarnishes their reputation. Consumers may become wary of engaging with the brand, fearing they could fall victim to scams or receive bad products or services.
3. **Decreased consumer trust:** In an era rife with identity theft and impersonation, consumers are understandably cautious. The prevalence of fraudulent advertisements erodes trust in digital advertising platforms, making consumers less likely to click on ads or engage with sponsored content. This lack of confidence undermines the effectiveness of digital marketing efforts, reducing the return on investment for businesses.
4. **Legal risks**: Businesses implicated in these schemes may face legal repercussions and regulatory scrutiny. Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be laws and regulations governing data privacy, consumer protection, and deceptive advertising practices. Violations of these laws can result in fines, lawsuits, and damage to the company's reputation.
5. **Loss of competitive advantage:** A strong brand reputation is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. However, when a business's identity is compromised, it loses this edge. Competitors may capitalize on the situation to attract customers or exploit vulnerabilities in the affected company's market position. This loss of competitive advantage can have long-term implications for the business's growth and sustainability.

## Solution: Constant and global monitoring

In conclusion, safeguarding against the pervasive threat of identity theft and impersonation in the digital realm demands a proactive and multifaceted approach. Merely monitoring social media platforms is no longer sufficient, we must extend our surveillance to encompass search engines, domains, and other online channels.
