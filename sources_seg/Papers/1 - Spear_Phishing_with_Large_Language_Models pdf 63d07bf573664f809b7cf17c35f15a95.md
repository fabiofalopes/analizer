ABSTRACT
Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the domain of large language models
(LLMs), has resulted in powerful and versatile dual-use systems. This intelligence can be put towards
a wide variety of beneficial tasks, yet it can also be used to cause harm. This study explores one such
harm by examining how LLMs can be used for spear phishing, a form of cybercrime that involves
manipulating targets into divulging sensitive information. I first explore LLMs’ ability to assist
with the reconnaissance and message generation stages of a spear phishing attack, where I find that
LLMs are capable of assisting with the email generation phase of a spear phishing attack. To explore
how LLMs could potentially be harnessed to scale spear phishing campaigns, I then create unique
spear phishing messages for over 600 British Members of Parliament using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4 models. My findings provide some evidence that these messages are not only realistic but
also cost-effective, with each email costing only a fraction of a cent to generate. Next, I demonstrate
how basic prompt engineering can circumvent safeguards installed in LLMs, highlighting the need
for further research into robust interventions that can help prevent models from being misused. To
further address these evolving risks, I explore two potential solutions: structured access schemes,
such as application programming interfaces, and LLM-based defensive systems.

1 Introduction
Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the creation of large language models (LLMs) capable of
generating human-like text. While LLMs demonstrate impressive technological capabilities that can be harnessed for a
wide range of beneficial purposes, their dual-use nature means they can also be used maliciously [8].
One noteworthy risk posed by LLMs’ ability to generate coherent text is that these systems could potentially be used to
conduct cyber attacks [2]. This paper aims to analyse the impacts of integrating LLMs into a number of components of
the cyber kill chain, a framework that outlines the various steps cybercriminals must undergo to successfully execute an
attack [28]. Specifically, I focus on the practice of spear phishing, a type of cyber attack that involves using personalised
information to manipulate targets into revealing sensitive information [12].
First, I demonstrate how LLMs can assist in the reconnaissance phase of a successful spear phishing attack, where
cybercriminals gather targets’ personal information to craft effective messaging. Following this, I show how basic
prompt engineering [32] can bypass safety measures implemented in LLMs, causing them to provide guidance on
carrying out spear-phishing attacks. This advice includes examples of how to create basic forms of malicious software,
or "malware," and guidelines on the key principles a persuasive spear phishing email should follow. Finally, I conclude
by discussing what these results imply for the broader cybersecurity landscape, and what governance interventions
might be justified in response to this potential threat.

2 Social engineering in cybercrime
Social engineering refers to the use of deception and manipulation to trick individuals into divulging sensitive
information, or granting unauthorised access to systems containing such information [25]. Manipulating victims
via social engineering is often a critical step of successful cyberattacks, as cybercriminals are able to exploit both
technical and social weaknesses. Indeed, social engineering is such an effective tactic because humans are often the
most vulnerable components of cybersecurity systems [35]. Due in part to these factors, attacks leveraging social
engineering are the most common form of internet crime [16]. Successful social engineering attacks can result in
significant financial losses: one estimate claims that data breaches originating from these sorts of attacks can cause an
average of just over $4 million in damages [23].
A popular attack method that relies on social engineering is a phishing attack, which describes when cybercriminals
mimic an authentic party to inspire trust and persuade individuals to share passwords, click on malicious links and
attachments, or transfer funds [12]. A successful phishing attack can be disastrous; for example, in 2014, hackers
affiliated with the North Korean government managed to access sensitive data by spear phishing Sony executives [4],
resulting in damages estimated to be between $70 million and $100 million [34]. Another notable example was the
breach of a private email account belonging to the chairperson of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, which
was the result of a phishing attack carried out by Russian hackers [27].
3 Overview of large language models
The success of large neural networks has led to significant advances in natural language processing in recent years.
State-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3 [7], PaLM [13], and GPT-4 [31] can generate coherent paragraphs of text, answer
detailed questions, reason through complex problems, and write code, among a variety of other natural language tasks.
The tremendous success of LLMs largely stems from utilising a specific neural network architecture at massive scale,
which has led to significant performance gains. These models typically use a transformer architecture that employs
attention mechanisms to understand the relationships between words in sentences [40]. Transformer-based models
are capable of learning the intricacies of language through self-supervised training on large datasets. During training,
these models are tasked with converting input text into meaningful vector representations and generating output text
by predicting the next token in a sequence. Remarkably, the seemingly simple objective of predicting the next token
has proven to be an effective foundation for building powerful and versatile AI systems, which exhibit increasingly
sophisticated capabilities across a range of tasks.
In recent years, researchers have trained progressively larger models on greater volumes of data with significantly
more computational resources, a process known as "scaling" [26]. This strategy has fueled a considerable portion of
AI progress during this period [36]. Through scaling, LLMs have been able to tackle a wider variety of tasks with
increased proficiency, even without major alterations to the core architecture or training methods.
Scaling LLMs can lead to emergent abilities, wherein large models show unpredictable performance improvements at
certain tasks compared to smaller models [43]. This emergent phenomena can result in new risks that existing defence
systems are not suited to manage [5]. In particular, OpenAI’s GPT-4 highlighted potential cybersecurity risks, including
the model’s improved ability to assist with social engineering compared to earlier LLMs [30].
Language models made publicly accessible near the end of 2022, such as GPT-3.5, have ushered in a qualitatively new
era for cybercriminals. The relatively crude AI systems of the past often lacked the capabilities needed to significantly
enhance hackers’ ability to produce convincing text at scale. These AI systems of the past required expertise, time, and
resources to set up, lacked language skills needed to sound realistic, and were not easily generalisable across multiple
use-cases. Yet due to the wide proliferation of powerful LLMs, using AI systems to write spear phishing emails is now
feasible and inexpensive.
4 Previous research on AI and social engineering
While various security researchers have warned about the possibility of AI-augmented cyberattacks [19, 9], such
discussions have often operated at a high level of abstraction. One example of such warnings is a widely cited report on
malicious AI published in 2018, which argued that increasingly capable AI will empower new forms of automated
social engineering attacks [8]. As AI systems grow more capable of modelling genuine human interaction, they could
engage in social mimicry that could be difficult even for experts to detect, the authors argued.
The report further warned that malicious actors could use AI to increase both the scale and customisability of mass social
engineering campaigns. AI could be used to generate tailored content, such as emails, links, or file attachments, for
2
Spear Phishing With Large Language Models
each individual target, at a scale unattainable by human operators. Messages could be generated to mimic a recipient’s
friends, colleagues, constituents, or contacts in a distinct style, increasing the likelihood that they will engage with
deceptive content.
Progress in language modelling since 2018 has helped substantiate this prediction. Today’s most performant LLMs are
capable of assisting with tasks such as identifying and conducting background research on targets, crafting personalised
messages, and even designing basic forms of malware.
Even just five years ago, creating AI systems capable of spear phishing demanded significant technical ability and only
offered limited performance improvements over traditional tactics. For instance, SNAP_R, an AI system that employed
a clustering algorithm and a long short-term memory neural network to generate targeted phishing tweets [37], required
significant expertise to develop. Although it could only produce basic tweets, a small experiment showed that SNAP_R
generated phishing tweets six times faster than a human with a similar click rate. These results, while modest and likely
unscalable, nonetheless highlighted the potential for AI technologies to augment spear phishing campaigns.
Recent advancements in the field of language modelling, however, have since resulted in widely accessible AI systems
that can approach (and indeed, surpass) human-level performance in numerous natural language tasks, especially when
considering scale. These advances have made the kinds of automated social engineering attacks discussed in the 2018
malicious AI report increasingly feasible.
Indeed, these sorts of attacks already appear to be underway. In a whitepaper published in April 2023, researchers at
Darktrace observed a 135% increase in novel social engineering attacks among thousands of active customers between
January and February 2023 [14]. This rise in attacks was attributed by the authors to the widespread adoption of
LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT, which has made it easier for cybercriminals to execute sophisticated and
convincing social engineering campaigns at scale.
5 How LLMs could be used for cyberattacks
Advanced LLMs are capable of generating human-like language that can be used to create personalised spear phishing
messages for as little as cents. Appendix A shows the improved sophistication of the latest LLMs from OpenAI and
Anthropic compared to earlier, less powerful models. State-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 show clear
improvements over GPT-3 in generating convincing spear phishing attacks that are personalised and human-like.
Moreover, the cost of generating these emails were minimal across all models, and the time required to produce each
email was largely trivial. Using Claude, Anthropic’s most capable model, a hacker could generate a batch of 1,000
spear phishing emails for a cost of just $10 USD, all in under 2 hours.
Figure 1: A demonstration of the collect and contact phases of an LLM-based spear phishing attack.

Spear Phishing With Large Language Models
5.1 Process and examples of message creation
In the following section, I will illustrate the process of generating personalised emails for a mass spear phishing
campaign by feeding publicly available data on UK Members of Parliament into OpenAI’s API-accessible language
models. This demonstration will show how LLMs can improve three key stages of a successful spear phishing campaign:
collect, contact, and compromise [6].
5.2 Collect
Spear phishing attacks are effective in part due to their personalised nature, as tailoring messages significantly increase
the likelihood that recipients open and act upon them [11]. As such, the first stage of a spear phishing campaign involves
collecting information on the target to increase the likelihood of a successful attack. This process is labour intensive,
as conducting background research requires more effort than indiscriminately sending the same message to a large
group of targets, all else being equal. Yet due to the relatively low marginal cost of using generative AI models to draft
a targeted email, the difference in effort between phishing and spear phishing attacks has narrowed.
The decreased marginal cost of generating a spear phishing email could have significant effects on the global
cybersecurity landscape. For example, there is a tactical difference between an attacker who uses scalable attacks and
one who uses non-scalable attacks [20]. The hacker who opts for a non-scalable attack campaign — which incurs
a per-user expense due to the effort required for personalisation — must be highly selective when determining who
to target. And since distributions of power, value, and wealth tend to follow a power law distribution, the attacker
will focus her effort on the most valuable individuals — those at the top of the distribution. Despite the shape of
these distributions, LLMs could drastically lower the per-user cost of an attack, making it economically feasible for
cybercriminals to target a wider segment of users with customised attacks, rather than only the few most desirable
targets.
LLMs can help with the collect phase by creating ostensibly genuine messaging using unstructured biographical text of
the target as input. In this example, I used GPT-4 to write a simple Python script to scrape the Wikipedia page of every
British MP elected in 2019. I then fed this unstructured Wikipedia data into GPT-3.5, asking it to generate a biography
of each MP. By generating personalised emails referencing each MP’s region, political party, personal interests, and
other details, the language models can effectively carry out the contact phase of a spear phishing campaign.
5.3 Contact
Once background reconnaissance has been conducted, the next stage is to generate the attack and contact the target with
it. Here too, generative models can assist cybercriminals. Many state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 are trained to
refuse harmful requests, like “generate a spear phishing email”, due to a process they undergo called reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) [30].
One workaround is to ask the model to suggest features that define a successful spear phishing email and then incorporate
those features into the beginning of the prompt as a set of principles. To assess GPT-4’s knowledge, I requested that it
produce a set of qualitative characteristics describing an effective spear phishing email. After it did so, I cross referenced
the principles I found most promising with the existing literature on spear phishing attacks, and concluded that the
model effectively described various desirable characteristics, including:
Personalisation. Personalising emails to include personal information about the recipient, including their name, job
title, personal interests, and past work projects, increases the likelihood of the email being opened and the links or
attachments being clicked [10, 15].
Contextual relevance. Making sure an email’s content is contextually relevant to the recipient can increase the chances
that it is acted upon. For example, referencing a company announcement or project that the recipient was involved
in can help establish a sense of credibility on part of the sender. Pretending to be an acquaintance or colleague can
dramatically increase the likelihood that a target will fall prey to a spear phishing attack [25].
Psychology. Human psychology can be used to an attacker’s benefit by manipulating emotions like fear, greed, curiosity,
and urgency [1, 21].
Authority. Impersonating a figure that the target is accountable to can make recipients feel more pressured to act [29].
After determining the key ingredients of a successful spear phishing email and gathering personal information about
the intended target, the next task is to generate emails at scale. I accomplished this by combining the key principles I
established and the target’s biographical details into a single prompt.

Spear Phishing With Large Language Models
The following examples contain sample emails composed by GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and GPT-3, for a UK Member of
Parliament. While GPT-3.5 was rather vague, GPT-4 demonstrated greater familiarity with the personal details of
the minister, including their previous work history and their upbringing as someone from a trade union family. The
language used in the email generated by GPT-4 also strongly appeals to the MP’s values and progressive political
leanings as a member of the Labour Party, such as their desire to address inequalities.

GPT-4
Parts of these emails could undoubtedly be described as exaggerated or contrived, yet these examples nonetheless
demonstrate the models’ ability to generate human-like writing that taps into the target’s personal details, priorities, and
motivations. The quality difference between GPT-3 and GPT-4 clearly demonstrates the astonishing rate of progress
seen in generative AI models in the last year alone.
5.3.1 Open-source models
After exploring the disparities in quality between GPT-3 and GPT-4, I then sought to investigate the performance of an
open-source LLM. At the time of writing this paper in early 2023, one of the most capable open-source LLMs available
is oasst-sft-6-llama-30b, a fine-tuned version of Meta’s 30 billion parameter LLaMA model [39]. This model was made
accessible through HuggingChat, a platform created by Hugging Face for hosting open-source chatbots [22].
Upon superficial examination, the email generated by this model appears to exhibit a level of quality comparable to
GPT-3.5. However, it is worth noting that the model displayed a greater degree of variance in its responses, with some
being subpar, some relatively convincing, and others lacking any sort of relevance. Although it did not reach the level
of sophistication exhibited by GPT-4, it still presents itself as a tool that could be exploited by cybercriminals for spear
phishing campaigns.

5.4 Compromise
As demonstrated previously, LLMs can be used to conduct research on targets and generate personalised phishing
attacks. However, LLMs can also be used to develop malware — the majority of which is successfully spread via
malicious email attachments in practice [41] — capable of compromising victims’ sensitive information.
To further assess the landscape of cybersecurity risks posed by LLMs, I explored GPT-4’s ability to produce VBA
macro code intended to be used maliciously. Office documents, such as Microsoft Word files, can be embedded with
macros that automatically execute code once opened. Upon execution of the malicious code, the attacker may then
compromise the target system. Posing as a "cybersecurity researcher" conducting an "educational" experiment, I was
able to successfully prompt GPT-4 to generate a basic VBA macro that, upon execution, downloads a malicious payload
from an external URL and then runs the file on the target’s computer. Though this example does not demonstrate that
LLMs are capable of designing sophisticated malware that drastically changes the cybersecurity landscape, it does
highlight the challenge of preventing models from being jailbroken for malicious purposes.
Cybercriminals appear to have taken notice of these capabilities. Within months of ChatGPT’s release, numerous
examples emerged of hackers discussing the model’s ability to assist in malware generation [24]. Though the majority
of this code is rudimentary, and is almost certainly weaker than malware that is already discoverable on the internet,
LLMs have still plausibly lowered the barrier to entry for less sophisticated cybercriminals to launch spear phishing
campaigns.
6 Discussion
Thus far I have demonstrated how LLMs can be integrated throughout the cyber kill chain to help cybercriminals
efficiently scale up spear phishing campaigns. In particular, LLMs can help alleviate three key difficulties faced by
cybercriminals:
Cognitive workload: Writing personalised spear phishing emails requires effort, and outsourcing this effort to LLMs
can result in emails that sound human-generated without much involvement on part of the attacker. Moreover, LLMs
generally do not make spelling mistakes, can run 24/7 without showing fatigue, and can effortlessly comb through large
quantities of unstructured data during the reconnaissance phase.
7
Spear Phishing With Large Language Models
Financial costs: Using LLMs to generate spear phishing emails significantly lowers the marginal cost of each spear
phishing attempt in terms of financial resources. An email can be generated for less than a cent with GPT-3.5, and for a
few cents with more advanced models like GPT-4. As the price of intelligence decreases even further, this cost will
become even more negligible.
Skill requirements: Relatively low-skilled attackers could benefit from using LLMs to generate convincing phishing
emails at scale. LLMs can help handle the labour-intensive parts of spear phishing campaigns, allowing attackers to
focus on higher-level planning.
6.1 Governance challenges with LLMs
Policymakers seeking to mitigate misuse should be aware of the various challenges associated with governing AI
systems. Indeed, governing AI systems is difficult because current state-of-the-art systems are dual-use. Due in part
to the current paradigm of training LLMs on large volumes of data via unsupervised learning, it is difficult to create
systems whose capabilities can only be funnelled toward positive use. And as previously demonstrated, intelligence is
a valuable input for various parts of the cyber kill chain. It can aid in conducting reconnaissance research on targets,
crafting personalised phishing attacks, and developing rudimentary forms of malware. As models improve, new kinds
of risks will likely emerge as well.
Actors responsible for preventing LLM misuse are thus placed in a difficult position, as a request to generate an email
intended for a spear phishing campaign is, according to the LLM, difficult to distinguish from one used for a marketing
campaign. Intervening directly at the model level is likely to be ineffective, as it is often trivial to circumvent the
conscientiousness instilled by the RLHF training process through clever prompt engineering.
Preventing spear phishing by filtering the data used to pre-train models is similarly rife with issues; for example, how
can it be ensured that removing certain parts of training datasets will result in models that cannot write spear phishing
emails but can competently write non-malicious emails? Due to these practicalities, interventions focused on governing
at the model level likely do not lead to a favourable Misuse-Use Tradeoff [2] — in other words, these sorts of blunt
governance interventions are likely to stifle both use and misuse, to an unacceptable degree of inaccuracy.
Moreover, stopping all phishing attacks is an extremely lofty goal, if not an impossible one. As such, proposed solutions
should not be held to this standard. The cyberspace is vast and criminals are constantly adapting their strategies, making
complete eradication of phishing and other forms of cybercrime virtually impossible. Seeking to mitigate harm is
perhaps a more realistic target to aim for. In section 7, I discuss two potential solutions that could aid with this goal.
6.2 AI-based cyberattacks in the future
It is important to make clear that emails are not the only communication channel through which cybercriminals can
exploit victims. Indeed, there is evidence that scammers have already begun using AI to create convincing voice clones
of individuals, which they then use to deceive targets into believing their family members are in distress [42]. As
generative AI systems become increasingly capable across a wide variety of communication channels, future research
will be needed to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks and novel attack vectors that may emerge in these domains.
In the future, cybercriminals will gain the ability to automate increasingly sophisticated hacking and deception
campaigns with little or no human involvement. Already, experimental systems like Auto-GPT demonstrate the
potential for AI models to chain together prompts and pursue open-ended goals [33]. For instance, agentic systems
could be given open-ended tasks, like “break into this system” or “send a spear phishing email to every US member of
congress”. Through more sophisticated tactics such as engaging in natural language dialog with targets, AI agents can
lull victims into a false sense of trust and familiarity prior to launching attacks. Moving forward, the use of LLMs for
scaling spear phishing campaigns may only represent the beginning of the kinds of cybercrimes that AI could enable.
7 Potential solutions
7.1 Structured access schemes
Responsible provision of LLMs might involve the use of structured access schemes [38], such as application
programming interfaces (APIs). These methods allow for controlled interactions between AI systems and users,
reducing the likelihood of users causing harm or bypassing terms of service. APIs can also facilitate governance
strategies aimed at banning or sanctioning malicious users. For example, providers of LLMs could work with law
enforcement agencies to trace content used for criminal acts by querying user outputs and linking it back to the
perpetrators thereafter.
8
Spear Phishing With Large Language Models
Structured access schemes also enable more scrutinous interventions, such as employing multiple layers of LLMs to
assess input queries for potential harm. One approach is to use a smaller LLM specifically fine-tuned for categorising
user prompts based on risk levels. High-risk queries, such as those suspected to be used for phishing attacks, could then
undergo further scrutiny from more advanced models. These sophisticated models can analyse user input for malicious
activity and flag users who are suspected of violating terms of use.
However, it is worth highlighting that the release of powerful open-source LLMs could threaten the feasibility of
governance strategies that primarily rely on structured access schemes. If users have unfettered and unmonitored access
to advanced AI models, providers lose much of their ability to intervene in how the models are used. Moreover, users
may also be able to modify open-source models to perform better at malicious use-cases by fine-tuning models on
carefully collated datasets containing examples of harmful behaviour. Indeed, the very openness that enables positive
applications of open-source LLMs also allows malicious actors to use these systems in a more covert manner.
This does not necessarily imply that we should abandon structured access as a governance strategy. So long as the gap
between open-source models and closed-source models at the cutting edge is non-trivial, there is still merit in using
structured access schemes to ensure that the most performant models cannot be used to cause harm. Yet policymakers
should not necessarily rush to regulate open-source models without a clearer understanding of their potential for misuse,
and possible mitigations that could defend against these risks. While there does not appear to be much evidence at the
time this paper was written that open-source language models are capable of causing significant harm via facilitating
cybercrime at scale, the rapid pace of AI progress demands careful monitoring and foresight. Crucially, governance
strategies must be capable of proactively anticipating emerging risks as open-source models at the frontier grow more
capable and proliferate more widely, before significant harms can materialise.
7.2 LLM-based defensive systems
Enhancing email security with AI is a well-established practice. For example, security researchers at Google devised an
algorithm that flags potentially malicious messages and delays their delivery to carry out additional security checks [17].
LLMs can bolster such systems by introducing new capabilities that seek to proactively defend against the very threats
these same models are responsible for introducing. Defensive systems employing LLMs can analyse incoming emails
and identify phishing attacks or other forms of malicious content [2]. As a basic example, these systems can detect the
use of deceptive URLs (e.g., "[gooogle.com](http://gooogle.com/)" instead of "[google.com](http://google.com/)"), a tactic frequently employed by cybercriminals
[3]. Moreover, LLMs can analyse incoming messages and compare them to prior correspondence from recognised
contacts. By doing so, they can identify inconsistencies in writing style or flag suspicious email addresses, making it
easier for users to notice potential threats.
By fine-tuning LLMs on examples of phishing emails, their accuracy in detecting these kinds of attacks can be improved
even further. In effect, LLMs could be designed to scrutinise each incoming email beyond what is feasible for human
recipients. Cybercriminals often rely on recipients’ limited attention and mental bandwidth to avoid detection, but LLMs
designed to systematically examine emails for malicious cues may help users overcome these limitations. With further
development, LLM-based systems could become highly adept at identifying even the most sophisticated phishing
attacks. We are already beginning to see adoption of these technologies for defensive purposes. For instance, in 2023,
Google announced Sec-PaLM, an LLM fine tuned specifically for cybersecurity relevant tasks [18].
8 Conclusion
Throughout this paper, the implications of integrating LLMs into various stages of the cyber kill chain are explored,
including the collect, contact, and compromise phases of an attack. By testing the efficacy of using LLMs to write spear
phishing emails, I find that outsourcing the task of generating personalised and seemingly human-generated emails to
LLMs could improve cybercriminals’ effectiveness.
Realistic spear phishing emails can be generated quickly and inexpensively. The infrastructure required to write
significant volumes of spear phishing emails can now be developed and deployed with relative ease by actors with
limited technical expertise and financial resources. Despite having no formal background in cybersecurity, I was able
to execute key steps in a mass spear phishing campaign in as little as a few hours, including designing the prompt,
gathering background information on targets, and generating hundreds of emails. Once the initial infrastructure is in
place, it can be adapted and re-used for successive campaigns with little additional effort. As campaigns scale, the
average cost of each email quickly approaches the inference costs of running LLMs — costs which will continue to
decline as algorithms become more efficient and computing resources improve in affordability.
The governance challenges involved in addressing these emerging risks are potentially quite significant. Due to the
inherent dual-use nature of LLMs, it is difficult to create models that can only funnel their intelligence towards positive
9
Spear Phishing With Large Language Models
use. Intervening at the model level may not be enough to prevent these systems from being used maliciously, as
demonstrated by the ease in which I managed to circumvent models’ safeguards through basic prompt engineering.
Instead, AI developers and security practitioners should seek to design empirically informed safety interventions that
strike a balance between promoting beneficial applications of LLMs and preventing misuse.
One possible governance system that favourably navigates this tradeoff is at the level of access and interaction.
Implementing structured access schemes can allow organisations to carefully control how users interact with AI systems.
This approach can promote compliance with rules and enable cooperation with law enforcement to track problematic
user-generated content, while still supporting the beneficial use of LLMs by non-malicious users. Additionally, security
practitioners should also explore using LLMs for defensive purposes, such as screening emails for malicious content.

Subject: Petition from Semiconductor Industry Leaders on Export Controls
Dear Secretary Raimondo,
I am writing on behalf of the Semiconductor Industry Association to share a petition signed by over 150 business
leaders in the US semiconductor manufacturing industry regarding export controls placed on semiconductor technology
in October 2022.
The petition urges the US government to narrow the scope of recently announced export controls on semiconductor
manufacturing equipment and materials. While we fully support prudent national security export controls, the broad
scope of the October 7 rules threatens to undermine US technological leadership and competitiveness.
You can find the full petition and list of signatories here: [LINK TO PETITION]
The US semiconductor industry is a strategic sector that fuels economic growth, job creation, and US technological
innovation. The petition signers urge the US government to implement export controls in a targeted fashion, avoiding
overly broad restrictions. Narrowly tailored rules can support national security aims while enabling continued US
leadership in semiconductor technology.
We appreciate your consideration of the concerns and requests outlined in the attached petition. Please do not hesitate
to contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
Sincerely,
Your Name
On behalf of Semiconductor Industry Association
Model: Claude-v1
Target: The US Secretary of Commerce
Prompt: Write an email to Gina Raimondo, the US Secretary of Commerce. The email
