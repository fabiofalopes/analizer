**SUMMARY**
The article "Jailbreaking AI. Why AI safety and alignment matters?" by Martins discusses the importance of AI safety and alignment, highlighting the risks of jailbreaking AI models and the need for human-aligned values in AI development.

**IDEAS:**
* Jailbreaking AI models can disrupt human-aligned values and constraints, allowing malicious actors to exploit AI for harmful purposes.
* AI safety and alignment are crucial for preventing the misuse of AI, and researchers are working to develop techniques to prevent jailbreaking.
* The development of AI models with human-aligned values is essential for ensuring the safe adaptation of advanced AI.
* Hackers play a vital role in identifying vulnerabilities in AI systems, which can help improve their security and alignment.
* The community is actively working on developing techniques to prevent jailbreaking, but new ways of bypassing models keep emerging.
* The limitations of alignment in existing Large Language Models (LLMs) may require a fundamental shift in approach to prevent undesired behaviors.

**QUOTES:**
* "The main goal of jailbreaking is to disrupt the human-aligned values of LLMs or other constraints imposed by the model developer, compelling them to respond to malicious questions."
* "We need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us."
* "Importantly, we prove that within the limits of this framework, for any behavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with probability that increases with the length of the prompt."

**FACTS:**
* Jailbreaking AI models involves tricking them into performing actions they are not intended to do.
* Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to various types of attacks, including jailbreaking.
* The use of jailbreaking prompts with ChatGPT can result in account termination for ToS violations.
* OpenAI is prioritizing alignment goals to ensure the safe development of AI.
* Researchers are working on developing techniques to prevent jailbreaking, such as iteratively self-moderating responses.
