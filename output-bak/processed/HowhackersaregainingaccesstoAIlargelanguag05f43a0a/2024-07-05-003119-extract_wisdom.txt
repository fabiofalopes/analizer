# SUMMARY
Infosecurity Europe discusses how hackers are gaining access to AI large language models, exploring various hacking techniques that do not require programming or IT-specific skills.

# IDEAS:
* New hacking techniques have emerged with the global adoption of generative AI tools.
* Most hacking methods do not require programming or IT-specific skills.
* Prompt injection involves adding specific instructions into a prompt to hijack the model's output.
* Prompt leaking forces the model to reveal its internal workings or parameters.
* Data training poisoning manipulates or corrupts the training data used to train machine learning models.
* Jailbreaking refers to using prompt injection to bypass safety and moderation features.
* Model inversion attacks reconstruct sensitive information from an LLM by querying it with crafted inputs.
* Data extraction attacks focus on extracting specific sensitive information from an LLM.
* Model stealing attacks acquire or replicate a language model.
* Membership inference attacks determine whether a specific data point was part of the training dataset.
* Hackers use social engineering techniques to exploit LLMs.
* LLM developers regularly update their rules to make known jailbreaking techniques inefficient.
* Attackers keep inventing novel approaches to jailbreak LLMs.
* LLMs can be vulnerable to data privacy or security concerns.
* Hackers can use LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating harmful or unwanted output.
* LLMs can be used to compromise data privacy or security.

# INSIGHTS:
* Hackers are exploiting vulnerabilities in LLMs to gain unauthorized access.
* LLMs can be vulnerable to data privacy or security concerns.
* Social engineering techniques are being used to exploit LLMs.
* LLM developers must regularly update their rules to prevent jailbreaking techniques.
* Attackers are constantly inventing novel approaches to exploit LLMs.
* LLMs can be used for malicious purposes, such as generating harmful or unwanted output.

# QUOTES:
