# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Hackers are using various techniques, including prompt injection, prompt leaking, and data training poisoning, to gain unauthorized access to large language models.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. New hacking techniques have emerged with the adoption of generative AI tools, especially large language model-based chatbots.
2. Prompt injection involves adding specific instructions into a prompt to hijack the model's output for malicious purposes.
3. Prompt leaking forces the model to reveal its internal workings or parameters, potentially compromising data privacy or security.
4. Data training poisoning manipulates or corrupts the training data used to train machine learning models.
5. Jailbreaking bypasses safety and moderation features placed on LLMs by their creators or restrictions imposed on a device's operating system.
6. Model inversion attacks reconstruct sensitive information from an LLM by querying it with carefully crafted inputs.
7. Data extraction attacks focus on extracting specific sensitive or confidential information from an LLM.
8. Model stealing attacks acquire or replicate a language model, partly or wholly.
9. Membership inference attacks determine whether a specific data point was part of the training dataset used to train a language model.
10. These hacking techniques can be used for malicious purposes, including intellectual property theft or violating licensing or usage agreements.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. Large language models are vulnerable to various hacking techniques that can be used for malicious purposes.
2. Hackers can use prompt injection, prompt leaking, and data training poisoning to gain unauthorized access to LLMs.
3. Jailbreaking and model inversion attacks can bypass safety features and extract sensitive information from LLMs.
4. Model stealing and membership inference attacks can be used for intellectual property theft or violating licensing or usage agreements.
5. It is essential to implement robust security measures to protect LLMs from these hacking techniques.
