# SUMMARY
Infosecurity Europe discusses how hackers are gaining access to AI large language models, exploring various hacking techniques, including prompt injection, prompt leaking, data training poisoning, jailbreaking, model inversion attack, data extraction attack, model stealing, and membership inference.

# IDEAS:
* New hacking techniques have emerged with the global adoption of generative AI tools.
* Most hacking methods do not require programming or IT-specific skills.
* Prompt injection involves adding specific instructions into a prompt to hijack the model's output.
* Prompt leaking forces the model to reveal its internal workings or parameters.
* Data training poisoning manipulates or corrupts the training data used to train machine learning models.
* Jailbreaking bypasses safety and moderation features placed on LLMs.
* Model inversion attacks reconstruct sensitive information from an LLM by querying it with crafted inputs.
* Data extraction attacks focus on extracting specific sensitive information from an LLM.
* Model stealing acquires or replicates a language model, partly or wholly.
* Membership inference attacks determine whether a specific data point was part of the training dataset.

# INSIGHTS:
* Hacking LLMs can compromise data privacy or security.
* Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the model's learning process.
* LLM developers regularly update their rules to make known jailbreaking techniques inefficient.
* Model inversion attacks can gain insights into confidential or private data used during training.
* Data extraction attacks can extract specific sensitive or confidential information from an LLM.

# QUOTES:
* "Hacking LLMs can compromise data privacy or security."
