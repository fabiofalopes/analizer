**ARGUMENT SUMMARY:** The article discusses various hacking techniques used to exploit large language models (LLMs) and chatbots, including prompt injection, prompt leaking, data training poisoning, jailbreaking, model inversion attack, data extraction attack, model stealing, and membership inference.

**TRUTH CLAIMS:**

**CLAIM:** New hacking techniques have emerged with the global adoption of generative AI tools.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:** The article cites the discovery of prompt injection attacks by LLM security company Preamble in early 2022, and the publication of this technique by two data scientists, Riley Goodside and Simon Willison. (Source: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/)

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** None found.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** B (High)

**LABELS:** Informative, Technical, Neutral

**CLAIM:** Prompt injection attacks involve adding specific instructions into a prompt to hijack the model's output for malicious purposes.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:** The article provides examples of prompt injection attacks, including Riley Goodside's demonstration of tricking OpenAI's GPT-3 model by adding specific instructions, context, or hints within the prompt. (Source: https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1569128808308957185)
