# SUMMARY
Dr. Milan MilanoviÄ‡ discusses Facebook's automated tool, SAPFIX, which detects and repairs bugs in software.

# IDEAS:
* Facebook engineers created a tool that can automatically fix bugs in software.
* SAPFIX is an automated tool that detects and repairs bugs in software.
* The tool has suggested fixes for six essential Android apps in the Facebook App Family.
* SAPFIX uses a technique called "spectrum-based fault localization" to identify the most likely lines of code responsible for the crash.
* The tool employs two strategies to suggest fixes: template-based and mutation-based approaches.
* SAPFIX uses predefined templates to suggest fixes for common bugs.
* The tool resorts to a mutation-based system if the template-based approach fails.
* The proposed solution is tested to ensure its validity using test cases from Sapienz.
* Infer is used to analyze the proposed fix further and check for potential issues.
* Developers review and approve the final fix.

# INSIGHTS:
* Automated tools can significantly improve the efficiency of bug detection and repair.
* Spectrum-based fault localization is an effective technique for identifying the source of bugs.
* Template-based and mutation-based approaches can be used to suggest fixes for common bugs.
* Testing and validation are crucial steps in ensuring the effectiveness of automated bug repair tools.
* Human review and approval are still necessary to ensure the quality of automated fixes.
