**SUMMARY**
Dr. Milan MilanoviÄ‡ shares a Facebook document on a tool that automatically fixes bugs, introducing SUPFIX, an automated tool that detects and repairs software bugs.

**IDEAS**
* Facebook engineers created a tool that can automatically fix bugs in software.
* The tool, SUPFIX, detects and repairs bugs in software.
* SUPFIX has suggested fixes for six essential Android apps in the Facebook App Family.
* SUPFIX uses a technique called "spectrum-based fault localization" to identify the most likely lines of code responsible for the crash.
* SUPFIX employs two strategies to suggest fixes: template-based fixing and mutation-based fixing.
* The tool uses test cases to check the patch's validity and Infer to analyze the proposed fix further.

**QUOTES**
* None

**FACTS**
