ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Facebook engineers developed an automated tool called SOPFIX that can detect and repair bugs in software.

MAIN POINTS:
1. SOPFIX is an automated tool that detects and repairs bugs in software.
2. The tool uses a technique called "spectrum-based fault localization" to identify the most likely lines of code responsible for a crash.
3. SOPFIX proposes a solution using predefined templates or code mutations.
4. The tool tests the proposed solution to ensure its validity.
5. Developers review and approve the fix.
6. SOPFIX has suggested fixes for six essential Android apps in the Facebook App Family.
7. The tool uses a mutation-based system if the template-based approach fails.
8. SOPFIX uses Infer, a static analysis tool, to analyze the proposed fix further.
9. The tool has been used to detect and repair bugs in Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, FBLite, Workplace, and Workchat.
10. SOPFIX is designed to automate the bug fixing process, reducing the need for manual intervention.

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Automated bug fixing tools like SOPFIX can improve software development efficiency.
2. SOPFIX's use of spectrum-based fault localization and mutation-based systems makes it a powerful tool for detecting and repairing bugs.
3. The tool's ability to suggest fixes for common bugs can reduce the workload of developers.
4. SOPFIX's integration with Infer ensures that proposed fixes do not introduce new potential issues.
5. The use of automated bug fixing tools can improve software quality and reliability.
