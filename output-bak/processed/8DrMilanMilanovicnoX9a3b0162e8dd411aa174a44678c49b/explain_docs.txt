# COMMON USE CASES

* For detecting and repairing bugs in software: SAPFIX can be used to automatically identify and fix bugs in software, making it a valuable tool for developers and software engineers.

# MOST IMPORTANT AND USED OPTIONS AND FEATURES

* Spectrum-based fault localization: This feature is used to identify the most likely lines of code responsible for a crash.
* Template-based fixing: SAPFIX uses predefined templates to suggest fixes for common bugs.
* Mutation-based fixing: SAPFIX resorts to a mutation-based system if the template-based approach fails, systematically applying a series of code mutations to the fault location to generate potential fixes.
* Test case validation: SAPFIX uses test cases to check the validity of proposed fixes.
* Static analysis: SAPFIX uses Infer, a static analysis tool, to analyze proposed fixes further and check for potential issues.
