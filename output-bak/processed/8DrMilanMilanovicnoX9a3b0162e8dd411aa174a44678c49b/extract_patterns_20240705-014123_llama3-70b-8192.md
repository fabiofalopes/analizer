# PATTERNS
* Facebook engineers created a tool to automatically fix bugs
* The tool, SOPFIX, detects and repairs bugs in software
* SOPFIX uses a combination of template-based and mutation-based fixing
* The tool has suggested fixes for six essential Android apps
* SOPFIX uses a technique called "spectrum-based fault localization"
* The tool employs two strategies for suggesting fixes
* SOPFIX uses predefined templates to suggest fixes for common bugs
* The tool resorts to a mutation-based system if the template-based approach fails
* SOPFIX systematically applies a series of code mutations to generate potential fixes
* The proposed solution is tested to ensure its validity
* The tool uses test cases from Sapienz to check the patch's validity
* Infer is used to analyze the proposed fix further
* Developers have the final say in reviewing and approving the fix

# META
* The idea of automatic bug fixing was mentioned by Dr. Milan MilanoviÄ‡
* The concept of SOPFIX was introduced in a paper by Facebook engineers
* The tool was designed to detect and repair bugs in software
* SOPFIX has been used to suggest fixes for six essential Android apps
* The technique of "spectrum-based fault localization" was used in SOPFIX
* The tool employs a combination of template-based and mutation-based fixing
* The paper explains the process of how SOPFIX works

# ANALYSIS
Facebook engineers have developed a tool, SOPFIX, that can automatically detect and repair bugs in software, using a combination of template-based and mutation-based fixing, and has suggested fixes for six essential Android apps.

# BEST 5
* SOPFIX can automatically detect and repair bugs in software
* The tool uses a combination of template-based and mutation-based fixing
* SOPFIX has suggested fixes for six essential Android apps
* The tool employs a technique called "spectrum-based fault localization"

# ADVICE FOR BUILDERS
* Consider using automated bug fixing tools like SOPFIX
* Implement a combination of template-based and mutation-based fixing
* Use techniques like "spectrum-based fault localization" to identify bugs
* Test proposed solutions to ensure their validity
* Have developers review and approve fixes before implementation
