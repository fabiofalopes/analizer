So today we're going to install Ableton Live latest version so so first thing we do is we've got to paste in our wine print fixers now that's 164-bit and I'll put the commands Down Below in the description then you do wine config just having all everything's fine then we want to install all these wine tricks this takes a while so basically we're installing all the MS XML passes and then the you'll see we install iTunes for some of the audio codecs and Microsoft Visual C plus plus libraries up to about 2005. and uh here instantly QuickTime I turn off automatically update because I don't want uh well I don't want anything to happen I just want it to stay exactly as it is and we just finished that no no thank you and next we're going to install a bunch of fonts so these are all the fonts uh you can do all fonts or you'll see the commands in the uh in the description so after the fonts have all installed and everything's all done then you want to uh next to run or go to the directory where you've downloaded the installer and then do wine64 the installer then you'll get the installation to come up this takes about five minutes to actually prepare itself and you'll get this Computing space requirements section this is the part that takes a while and when that's done you want to click next you want to agree obviously next and then next and then install install this will take you know quite some time but once this is done you'll be ready to go now there's a weird way of actually running Ableton you don't want to be doing wine the eggsy or wine start or whatever the way to do it is you do 164 space explorer.exe go to the folder and then double click on it and I'll show you exactly how that works now and if you don't do that it tries to look up all of your disks attached to your computer it's quite annoying and this is the only way that I got it to work currently so now it's all installed which is cool because this is Linux 64-bit now we wanted to explore.exe with wine 64 at the front of it now you've got your wine here go to your my computer go to the C drive go to program program files or program data sorry Ableton and then double click on the exe file when you want to license the application all you have to do is download the offline license and drag it into the Ableton window and it will it will license it so the key word there is dragging it in so I've already licensed it on a different folder on this computer but I'm going to show you just for reference so as you can see it's running beautifully azr works you can do inputs outputs midi controllers mini keyboards you know you can do you've got all your favorite enabled and you know live 11 Point whatever it is features this is the demo track or whatever it's called it's pretty Snappy like yeah it might not look Snappy in the video but it's incredibly Snappy um I honestly think it runs better than native so yeah everything's perfect exactly the way you would expect it to work on a Windows operating system and then I'm using Arch by the way so yeah if that helped uh give the video a like you can sub I'll put some more bringing some more tutorials to you soon but um yeah feel free to uh check it out I'll probably put a GitHub link up and um yeah you can join my Discord if you have any problems I've got telegram as well or you can follow follow my Twitter thanks
