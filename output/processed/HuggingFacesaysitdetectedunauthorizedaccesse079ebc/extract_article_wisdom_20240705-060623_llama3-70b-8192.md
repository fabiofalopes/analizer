# SUMMARY
Hugging Face detected unauthorized access to its AI model hosting platform, Spaces, and revoked tokens as a precaution, recommending users refresh keys and tokens and consider switching to fine-grained access tokens.

# IDEAS:
* Hugging Face detected unauthorized access to its AI model hosting platform, Spaces.
* The intrusion related to Spaces secrets, which are private pieces of information that act as keys to unlock protected resources.
* Hugging Face has revoked a number of tokens in those secrets as a precaution.
* Users whose tokens have been revoked have already received an email notice.
* Hugging Face recommends that all users refresh any key or token and consider switching to fine-grained access tokens.
* The company is working with outside cyber security forensic specialists to investigate the issue and review its security policies and procedures.
* Hugging Face has reported the incident to law enforcement agencies and Data protection authorities.
* The company pledges to use this as an opportunity to strengthen the security of its entire infrastructure.
* Hugging Face faces increasing scrutiny over its security practices.
* The company has seen a significant increase in cyberattacks in the past few months.
* Hugging Face is among the largest platforms for collaborative AI and data science projects with over one million models, data sets and AI-powered apps.

# QUOTES:
* "We deeply regret the disruption this incident may have caused and understand the inconvenience it may have posed to you."
* "We pledge to use this as an opportunity to strengthen the security of our entire infrastructure."
* "We've been seeing the number of cyberattacks increase significantly in the past few months, probably because our usage has been growing significantly and AI is becoming more mainstream."
