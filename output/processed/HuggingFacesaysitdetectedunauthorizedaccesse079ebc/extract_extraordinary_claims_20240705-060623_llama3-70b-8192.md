After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on a security incident at Hugging Face, an AI startup, and does not contain any conspiracy theories, misinformation, or denial of scientific truths.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to output as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
