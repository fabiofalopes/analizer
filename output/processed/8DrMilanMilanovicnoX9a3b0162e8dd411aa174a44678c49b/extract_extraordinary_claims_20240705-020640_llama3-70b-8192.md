I've analyzed the conversation and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts.

The conversation appears to be a factual report on a tool developed by Facebook engineers to automatically fix bugs in software. The tool, called SAPFIX, uses a combination of techniques to detect and repair bugs, and the conversation explains how it works in a clear and technical manner.

There are no quotes that indicate the person is a conspiracy theorist, engaging in misinformation, or denying commonly accepted scientific truths. The conversation is focused on explaining a technical topic in a neutral and informative way.

Therefore, I have no quotes to output as extraordinary claims.
