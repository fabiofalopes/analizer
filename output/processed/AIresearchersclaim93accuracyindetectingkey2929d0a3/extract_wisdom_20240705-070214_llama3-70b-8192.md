# SUMMARY
Researchers Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini, and Marhyam Mehrnezhad claim 93% accuracy in detecting keystrokes over Zoom audio, using a deep learning model to interpret remote keystrokes based on sound profiles of individual keys.

# IDEAS
* AI-backed side channel attackers can guess keystrokes by sound with 93% accuracy
* Researchers used a deep learning model to interpret remote keystrokes based on sound profiles of individual keys
* Laptops are more susceptible to having their keyboard recorded in quieter public areas
* Uniform, non-modular keyboards have similar acoustic profiles across models
* Combining keystroke interpretations with a hidden Markov model can correct errors
* Self-attention layers in neural networks can propagate an audio side channel attack
* Phone-recorded data and Zoom audio can be used to train a deep learning model
* Microfiber towels can reduce table vibration pickup
* Audio files can be transformed into machine-learning-friendly bits
* Changing typing style, using randomized passwords, and adding false keystrokes can mitigate attacks
* Biometric tools can be used instead of typed passwords
* Sound-based side channel attacks are a real threat
* Side channel attacks can be used to steal sensitive computer data
* Machine learning and webcam mics can be used to "see" a remote screen
* The "Dropmire" scandal likely involved a side channel attack
