# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Researchers achieve 93% accuracy in detecting keystrokes over Zoom audio using AI-backed side channel attack.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Researchers use deep learning model to interpret remote keystrokes with 93% accuracy.
2. Attack uses sound profiles of individual keys to detect keystrokes.
3. Laptops are more susceptible to keylogging in quieter public areas.
4. Uniform, non-modular keyboards make it easier to detect keystrokes.
5. Previous attempts achieved 91.7% and 74.3% accuracy in keylogging VoIP calls.
6. Combining keystroke interpretations with a hidden Markov model can correct errors.
7. Researchers used a 2021 MacBook Pro and iPhone 13 mini to test their concept.
8. Position of a key plays an important role in determining its audio profile.
9. False-classifications tend to be only one or two keys away.
10. Defenses include changing typing style, using randomized passwords, and adding false keystrokes.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. AI-backed side channel attacks can detect keystrokes with high accuracy over Zoom audio.
2. Laptops in quiet areas are more vulnerable to keylogging.
3. Uniform keyboards make it easier to detect keystrokes.
4. Defenses like changing typing style and using randomized passwords can mitigate attacks.
5. This research highlights the importance of securing sensitive computer data.
