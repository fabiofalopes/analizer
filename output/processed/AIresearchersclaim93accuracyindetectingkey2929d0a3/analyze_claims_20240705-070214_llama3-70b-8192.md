**ARGUMENT SUMMARY:** Researchers claim to have achieved 93% accuracy in detecting keystrokes over Zoom audio using a deep learning model.

**TRUTH CLAIMS:**

**CLAIM:** Researchers achieved 93% accuracy in detecting keystrokes over Zoom audio.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:**

* The researchers' paper, "A Practical Deep Learning-Based Acoustic Side Channel Attack on Keyboards," reports an accuracy of 93% in detecting keystrokes over Zoom audio. (Source: IEEE/Durham University)
* The paper provides detailed information on the methodology used, including the use of a deep learning model and a hidden Markov model to improve accuracy. (Source: IEEE/Durham University)

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:**

* None provided in the article.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:**

* None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** B (High)

**LABELS:** Technical, Research-based, AI-related, Security-focused

**OVERALL SCORE:**

LOWEST CLAIM SCORE: B (High)
HIGHEST CLAIM SCORE: B (High)
AVERAGE CLAIM SCORE: B (High)

**OVERALL ANALYSIS:** The article presents a well-researched and technical claim about the ability to detect keystrokes over Zoom audio using a deep learning model. The claim is supported by a detailed paper and methodology, and the article provides a clear explanation of the research. However, the article does not provide any counter-evidence or refutation of the claim, which would strengthen the overall analysis. Overall, the claim is well-supported and technically sound, but could benefit from more critical evaluation.
