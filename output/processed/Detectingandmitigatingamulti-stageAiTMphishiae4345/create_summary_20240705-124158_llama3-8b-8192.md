# Detecting and mitigating a multi-stage AiTM phishing and BEC campaign

## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Microsoft Defender Experts uncovered a multi-stage adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attack that used indirect proxy and session cookie theft to compromise identities and financial services organizations.

## MAIN POINTS:

1. The attack started with a phishing email from a trusted vendor, which was sent with a unique seven-digit code as the subject.
2. The email contained a link to a malicious URL hosted on Canva, which was used to host a fake OneDrive document preview and link to a phishing URL.
3. The phishing page was hosted on a Tencent cloud platform and spoofed a Microsoft sign-in page, requesting the target's password.
4. After the target provided the password, the attacker used the credentials in an authentication session created on the target website.
5. The attacker then used the stolen session cookie to sign in with the stolen cookie after a few hours from an IP address based in the United States.
6. The attacker added a new MFA method for the target's account, which was through phone-based one-time password (OTP), and created an Inbox rule to move all incoming emails to the Archive folder and mark them as read.
7. The attacker initiated a large-scale phishing campaign involving more than 16,000 emails with a slightly modified Canva URL.
8. The attack used indirect proxy and session cookie theft to compromise identities and financial services organizations.

## TAKEAWAYS:

1. AiTM phishing attacks are complex threats that require solutions that leverage signals from multiple sources.
2. MFA is an essential pillar in identity security and highly effective at stopping a wide variety of threats.
3. Implementing security defaults and enabling conditional access policies can help protect against AiTM phishing attacks.
4. Continuous monitoring and hunting for suspicious or anomalous activities are crucial in detecting and mitigating AiTM phishing attacks.
5. Microsoft 365 Defender uses its cross-domain visibility to detect malicious activities related to AiTM, such as session cookie theft and attempts to use stolen cookies for signing in.
