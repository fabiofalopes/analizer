# Detecting and mitigating a multi-stage AiTM phishing and BEC campaign

## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Microsoft Defender Experts uncovered a multi-stage adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attack that used indirect proxy and session cookie theft to compromise identities and financial services organizations.

## MAIN POINTS:

1. The attack started with a phishing email from a trusted vendor, which was sent with a unique seven-digit code as the subject.
2. The email contained a link to a malicious URL hosted on Canva, which was used to host a fake OneDrive document preview and link to a phishing URL.
3. The phishing page was hosted on a cloud service and used a fake Microsoft sign-in page to steal credentials.
4. The attacker used the stolen credentials to sign in to the target's account and modify the MFA settings to add a new MFA method.
5. The attacker then created an inbox rule to move all incoming emails to the Archive folder and marked all emails as read.
6. The attacker initiated a large-scale phishing campaign involving over 16,000 emails, which were sent to the compromised user's contacts and distribution lists.
7. The attacker used the stolen session cookie to impersonate the user and access email conversations and documents hosted in the cloud.
8. The attack was detected by Microsoft Defender Experts, who used advanced hunting detections and analysis to uncover the attack and identify the compromised users.

## TAKEAWAYS:

1. AiTM phishing attacks are becoming increasingly complex and use indirect proxy and session cookie theft to evade detection.
2. MFA is an essential pillar in identity security and should be implemented and enforced to prevent attacks.
3. Conditional access policies and continuous access evaluation can help detect and prevent suspicious sign-ins.
4. Advanced anti-phishing solutions and continuous monitoring of suspicious activities are necessary to detect and prevent attacks.
5. Microsoft Defender Experts can help detect and mitigate AiTM phishing and BEC attacks using advanced hunting detections and analysis.
