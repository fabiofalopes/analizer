# SUMMARY

Microsoft Defender Experts uncovered a multi-stage adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attack against banking and financial services organizations. The attack originated from a compromised trusted vendor and transitioned into a series of AiTM attacks and follow-on BEC activity spanning multiple organizations.

# IDEAS:

* Adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks use indirect proxy to evade detection
* AiTM attacks abuse trusted vendor relationships to blend with legitimate email traffic
* Phishing emails from trusted vendors can be used to compromise identities
* MFA is not enough to stop AiTM attacks, as attackers can add new MFA methods to sign in undetected
* Conditional access policies can help detect and prevent AiTM attacks
* Continuous access evaluation can help detect and prevent AiTM attacks
* Advanced anti-phishing solutions can help detect and block malicious emails and websites
* Continuous monitoring of suspicious activities is crucial to detect and prevent AiTM attacks
* AiTM attacks require solutions that leverage signals from multiple sources
* Microsoft 365 Defender uses cross-domain visibility to detect malicious activities related to AiTM
* Defender for Cloud Apps connectors can detect AiTM-related alerts in multiple scenarios
* AiTM attacks can be detected using hunting queries in Microsoft Sentinel

# INSIGHTS:

* AiTM attacks are complex threats that require solutions that leverage signals from multiple sources
* MFA is an essential pillar in identity security, but it is not enough to stop AiTM attacks
* Conditional access policies and continuous access evaluation can help detect and prevent AiTM attacks
* Advanced anti-phishing solutions and continuous monitoring of suspicious activities are crucial to detect and prevent AiTM attacks
* Microsoft 365 Defender and Defender for Cloud Apps can detect AiTM-related alerts in multiple scenarios
* Hunting queries in Microsoft Sentinel can be used to detect AiTM attacks

# QUOTES:

* "The attack achieved the end goal of a typical AiTM phishing attack followed by business email compromise."
* "The use of indirect proxy in this campaign provided attackers control and flexibility in tailoring the phishing pages to their targets."
* "The attackers used a legitimate service Canva for the phishing campaign."
* "The attacker then used the stolen cookie to impersonate the user, circumventing authentication mechanisms of passwords and MFA."
* "The attacker added a new MFA method for the target's account, which was through phone-based one-time password (OTP)."

# ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:

Microsoft Defender Experts uncovered a multi-stage AiTM phishing and BEC attack that used indirect proxy to evade detection and abused trusted vendor relationships to blend with legitimate email traffic.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:

* Implement MFA with conditional access policies
* Enable continuous access evaluation
* Use advanced anti-phishing solutions
* Continuously monitor suspicious activities
* Use hunting queries in Microsoft Sentinel to detect AiTM attacks
* Implement security defaults as a baseline set of policies
* Enable Defender for Cloud Apps connectors to detect AiTM-related alerts
* Use Microsoft 365 Defender to detect malicious activities related to AiTM
