# PATTERNS

* Prompt injection attacks can trick GenAI models into producing malicious content, leaking private data, or targeting other systems.
* Attackers use subtly written instructions to take control of LLM behavior, violating user-interaction rules and creating harmful output.
* PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement) is a method that employs a separate LLM and in-context learning to gradually create prompts until one succeeds.
* Direct prompt injections involve instructions that bypass security restrictions, while indirect injections turn LLMs into intermediary weapons to damage real targets.
* Stored prompt attacks involve models drawing contextual information from a source that conceals prompt attacks.
* Prompt leaking allows access to a model's internal prompts, yielding secret and valuable information related to intellectual property.
* Defense methods include Open Prompt Injection, StruQ, Signed-Prompt, Jatmo, BIPIA Benchmark, Maatphor, and HouYi.
* SQL injection attacks can target SQL-databases with techniques like drop tables, database records altering, and table contents dumping.
* Adversarial instruction blending can apply and boost prompt attacks through multi-modal LLMs.
* Prompt hacking competitions like HackAPromt focus on researching prompt attacks and feature creative approaches.
