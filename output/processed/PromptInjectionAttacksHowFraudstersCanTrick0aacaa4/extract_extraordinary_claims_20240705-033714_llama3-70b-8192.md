I've reviewed the provided text and did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The text appears to be a factual article discussing prompt injection attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) and various defense methods, tools, and solutions to mitigate these attacks.

The article provides a comprehensive overview of prompt injection attacks, including their types, examples, and defense strategies. It also discusses various research papers and experiments related to prompt injection attacks and defense methods. The text does not contain any claims that are conspiracy theories, misinformation, or contradictory to scientific consensus.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide as there are no extraordinary claims made in the text.
