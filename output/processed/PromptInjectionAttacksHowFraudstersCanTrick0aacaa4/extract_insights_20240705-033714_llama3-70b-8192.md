Here are the INSIGHTS section with 15-word bullets:

• Large Language Models are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, leaking private data and violating safety rules.
• Jailbreak approach tricks LLMs into producing harmful output, bypassing user-interaction rules and safety requirements.
• PAIR method employs a separate LLM and in-context learning to create successful prompts gradually.
• Direct prompt injections bypass security restrictions, while indirect injections target real targets, like email services.
• Stored prompt attacks conceal malicious instructions, and prompt leaking accesses internal prompts and sensitive data.
• Defense methods include paraphrasing, retokenization, separation of instructional and data prompts, and structured queries.
• Signed-Prompt method pre-signs commands to help LLMs identify intruders, and Jatmo uses instruction-tuned models.
• BIPIA Benchmark offers five solutions to impede prompt attacks, including border strings and datamarking.
• Maatphor uses automated variant analysis and seven rules to modify see prompts effectively.
• HouYi is a pentest tool that orchestrates prompt attacks with pre-constructed prompts and malicious payloads.
• SQL injection attacks can target databases, and prevention methods include database permission hardening.
• Adversarial instruction blending infuses malicious prompts into media, poisoning model dialogue with users.
• HackAPromt competition focuses on researching prompt attacks, including creative approaches and typo-based attacks.
