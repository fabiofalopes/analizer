Based on the provided essay, I will create a threat model for the input. Here is the output:

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Direct Prompt Injections: An attacker uses a text prompt to trick a GenAI model into delivering output that contradicts the law, moral norms, or user safety requirements.
* Indirect Prompt Injections: An attacker uses a GenAI model as an intermediary to damage real targets, such as a corporate service, a training dataset, web browsers, and so on.
* Stored Prompt Attack: A model draws more contextual information from a source that can conceal prompt attacks, allowing an attacker to leak sensitive data.
* Prompt Leaking: An attacker gains access to a model's internal prompts, which can yield secret and valuable information related to intellectual property.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The primary attack strategies are direct and indirect prompt injections, which can be used to trick a GenAI model into producing malicious content or leaking private data.
* The jailbreak approach is a common method used to orchestrate prompt injection attacks, which involves using a text prompt to take control of the LLM behavior and trick the system into violating its own user-interaction rules.
* The PAIR attack process is another method used to create prompts until one of them succeeds, which requires roughly 20 attempts.
* The use of LLMs as end goals or as intermediary weapons to damage real targets is a significant threat.
* The ability of attackers to use creative approaches, such as context termination, usage of typos, task deflection, syntactic transformation, and so on, makes prompt injection attacks a challenging threat to defend against.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Use paraphrasing to rewrite data prompts and retokenization to break tokens of words used into smaller tokens.
* Separate instructional and data prompts to prevent direct prompt injections.
* Use structured queries to format prompts and user data, and train LLMs with structured instruction-tuning.
* Implement signed-prompt methods to replace commands with character combinations that are never observed in human language.
* Use instruction-tuned models to generate datasets dedicated to a specific task and fine-tune a base-model.
* Implement Maatphor's automated variant analysis and creative approach to achieve the goal.
* Use HouYi's pre-constructed prompt, injection prompt for context partition, and malicious payload to reach the attack's goal.

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

Prompt injection attacks are a significant threat to GenAI models, as they can be used to trick a model into producing malicious content or leaking private data. The use of creative approaches and the ability to use LLMs as end goals or as intermediary weapons to damage real targets makes prompt injection attacks a challenging threat to defend against. It is essential to implement robust controls, such as paraphrasing, retokenization, and structured queries, to prevent direct prompt injections and indirect prompt injections. Additionally, using signed-prompt methods, instruction-tuned models, and Maatphor's automated variant analysis can help to mitigate the threat of prompt injection attacks.

**CONCLUSION**

Prompt injection attacks are a significant threat to GenAI models, and it is essential to implement robust controls to prevent and mitigate these attacks. By understanding the different types of prompt injection attacks, including direct and indirect prompt injections, stored prompt attacks, and prompt leaking, we can develop effective strategies to defend against these threats.
