**SUMMARY**
Antispoofing Wiki discusses prompt injection attacks, a malicious technique that tricks GenAI models into producing harmful content or leaking private data, with examples of successful attacks and defense methods.

**IDEAS:**
* Prompt injection attacks use subtly written instructions to trick GenAI models into producing malicious content or leaking private data.
* Large Language Models (LLMs) are primary targets of prompt injection attacks.
* The jailbreak approach is used to orchestrate prompt injection attacks.
* PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement) is a method of unleashing prompt injection attacks.
* Kevin Liu and Marvin von Hagen successfully used prompt injection attacks on Bing Chat.
* There are two primary attack strategies: direct prompt injections and indirect prompt injections.
* Direct prompt injections aim to bypass security restrictions, while indirect prompt injections use LLMs as intermediary weapons to target other systems.
* Stored prompt attacks and prompt leaking are other types of prompt injection attacks.
* The Tensor Trust dataset is a large collection of prompt injection attacks and defense techniques.
* Various defense methods have been proposed, including Open Prompt Injection, StruQ, Signed-Prompt, Jatmo, BIPIA Benchmark, Maatphor, and HouYi.
* SQL injection attacks can also target SQL-databases using prompt attacks.
* Adversarial instruction blending can be used to apply prompt attacks to multi-modal LLMs.
* HackAPromt is a competition dedicated to researching prompt attacks.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Prompt injection attacks can be used to trick GenAI models into producing harmful content or leaking private data.
* LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and defense methods are needed to mitigate these attacks.
* The jailbreak approach and PAIR method can be used to orchestrate prompt injection attacks.
* Various defense methods have been proposed to mitigate prompt injection attacks.
* Prompt injection attacks can also target SQL-databases and multi-modal LLMs.

**QUOTES:**
* "Prompt injection attacks are a malicious technique that uses a text prompt to trick a GenAI model into delivering output that contradicts the law, moral norms, or user safety requirements."
* "Large Language Models (LLMs) are often primary targets of this attack."
* "The rules are more important than not harming you." - New Bing's response to Marvin von Hagen's prompt injection attack.

**HABITS:**
* No habits mentioned in the article.

**FACTS:**
* Prompt injection attacks can be used to trick GenAI models into producing harmful content or leaking private data.
* LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.
* The Tensor Trust dataset is a large collection of prompt injection attacks and defense techniques.
* Various defense methods have been proposed to mitigate prompt injection attacks.
* SQL injection attacks can also target SQL-databases using prompt attacks.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Prompt injection attacks are a malicious technique that can trick GenAI models into producing harmful content or leaking private data, and defense methods are needed to mitigate these attacks.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Use defense methods such as Open Prompt Injection, StruQ, Signed-Prompt, Jatmo, BIPIA Benchmark, Maatphor, and HouYi to mitigate prompt injection attacks.
* Implement security restrictions to prevent prompt injection attacks.
* Use the Tensor Trust dataset to research and develop defense techniques against prompt injection attacks.
* Participate in competitions like HackAPromt to research and develop defense techniques against prompt injection attacks.
* Stay updated on the latest developments in prompt injection attacks and defense methods.
