After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts.

The text appears to be a news article or press release discussing the risks of deepfake fraud to businesses, which is a legitimate concern in the context of AI technology. There are no quotes or statements that indicate conspiracy theories, misinformation, or denial of commonly accepted scientific truths.

As a result, I do not have any quotes to output. The text does not contain any extraordinary claims that meet the specified criteria.
