**SUMMARY**

This paper discusses the possibility of using ChatGPT for preparing environments for executing social engineering based attacks. The authors present a scenario of creating a phishing attack using ChatGPT, with an overview of social engineering attacks and their prevention in general. The paper is organized into six chapters, covering the introduction to ChatGPT, the concept of social engineering, creating a phishing attack with the help of ChatGPT, social engineering attack prevention, and conclusion and further work.

**IDEAS**

1. ChatGPT can be used to create a phishing attack in just a few questions to the bot.
2. The phishing attack can be performed by creating a Facebook-like login page and sending a phishing email to the victim.
3. ChatGPT can help with generating code for managing form data and creating a phishing email content.
4. Social engineering attacks become easier to apply than ever, even without technical skills.
5. ChatGPT will provide answers to all questions that users ask, with excellent results in generating code and page layouts and template messages.
6. It is possible to get very quality replicates of any popular web site, code for processing malicious requests and messages, and email text that is realistic and similar to official notation.
7. ChatGPT will provide warnings about using generated resources in malicious purposes, but that won't stop potential attackers to use it.
8. The number of social engineering attacks will increase with the presence of AI solutions like ChatGPT.
9. It is important to learn how to defend yourself from these attacks and be careful when answering all requests.
10. ChatGPT could also provide some solutions for prevention of social engineering attacks.

**INSIGHTS**

1. Social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and easier to apply, even without technical skills.
2. ChatGPT can be used to create a phishing attack in just a few questions to the bot, making it a powerful tool for attackers.
3. The prevention of social engineering attacks requires a combination of best practices and the use of appropriate tools.
4. ChatGPT could provide some solutions for prevention of social engineering attacks, but it is not clear what these solutions would be.
5. The number of social engineering attacks will increase with the presence of AI solutions like ChatGPT, making it important to learn how to defend yourself from these attacks.
6. ChatGPT will provide warnings about using generated resources in malicious purposes, but that won't stop potential attackers to use it.
7. The prevention of social engineering attacks requires a combination of best practices and the use of appropriate tools, including free tools that can be developed in the future.
