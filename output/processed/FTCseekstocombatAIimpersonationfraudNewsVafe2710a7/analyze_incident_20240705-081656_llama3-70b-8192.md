This article does not describe a specific cybersecurity breach or hack. It discusses the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) efforts to combat AI impersonation fraud and strengthen anti-fraud measures. Therefore, it does not fit the format for extracting information about a cybersecurity breach.

However, I can provide a summary of the article:

Summary: The FTC is seeking to combat AI impersonation fraud by strengthening anti-fraud measures, including a proposed rule to declare it unlawful for companies to provide goods or services that facilitate impersonation scams.

Key Points:

* AI-generated "deepfakes" and other emerging technology have the potential to "turbocharge" impersonation fraud.
* The FTC is proposing a rule to strengthen anti-fraud measures, including allowing the agency to directly seek monetary relief from scammers.
* Impersonation scams resulted in $2 billion in stolen funds between October 2020 and September 2021, and $2.7 billion in losses in 2023.
