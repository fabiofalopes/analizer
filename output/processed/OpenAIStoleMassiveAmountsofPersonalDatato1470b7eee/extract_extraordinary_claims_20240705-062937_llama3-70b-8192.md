Here is the list of extraordinary claims extracted from the conversation:

• "OpenAI stole 'massive amounts of personal data' to train ChatGPT." 
• "The lawsuit alleges OpenAI crawled the web to amass huge amounts of data without people's permission."
• "AI could surpass human expertise in most areas within the next 10 years." 
• "AI poses an existential risk."
• "We face imminent and unreasonable risks of the very fabric of our society unraveling, at the hands of profit-driven, multibillion-dollar corporations."

Note: These claims are not necessarily false or debunked by the scientific community, but they are extraordinary and require further verification.
