• The increasing frequency of deepfake cases is a wake-up call for organisations and individuals to educate themselves on cybersecurity threats and risks.
• Cybersecurity measures are essential but insufficient amidst constantly evolving cyber threats, and people must fortify their 'human firewall' through education and awareness.
• Regular cybersecurity awareness training can empower people to exercise greater vigilance when receiving suspicious emails or calls, reducing the risk of falling victim to deepfake phishing scams.
• Organisations need to assess the risk of impersonation in targeted attacks and use multiple methods of communication and verification to avoid reliance on conference calls and VOIP.
• The ability to create realistic forgeries raises serious concerns, and malicious actors can exploit this technology to cause significant harm.
• Deepfakes can dominate news headlines, and the current situation may be a precursor to an even more dire scenario, highlighting the need for proactive measures.
• The real-world consequences of deepfakes are becoming alarmingly clear, and it is imperative to meticulously scrutinise and sanitise publicly accessible images and videos showcasing sensitive equipment and facilities.
