# PATTERNS
* Phishing attacks are a persistent cybersecurity threat that can be made more sophisticated with deepfake technology.
* Deepfakes can create realistic audio or video forgeries, making it harder to distinguish legitimate from malicious messages.
* Malicious actors can exploit deepfakes to spread misinformation, damage reputations, or launch sophisticated scams.
* Deepfakes can be used to scam consumers, especially older demographics, by impersonating celebrities or company officers.
* Open-source capabilities allow for pre-recorded deepfake generation using publicly available video footage or audio clips.
* Threat actors can use short clips to train deepfake models, but acquiring and pre-processing audio clips requires human intervention.
* Organisations need to assess the risk of impersonation in targeted attacks and use multiple methods of communication and verification.
* Executives' voices and likenesses have become part of an organisation's attack surface.
* Publicly accessible images and videos showcasing sensitive equipment and facilities should be thoroughly sanitised.
* Cybersecurity measures are essential, but education and awareness are crucial in identifying deepfake phishing attempts.
* Regular cybersecurity awareness training can empower people to exercise greater vigilance when receiving suspicious emails or calls.
* Combining strong cybersecurity measures with a well-trained and informed workforce can reduce the risk of falling victim to deepfake phishing scams.
