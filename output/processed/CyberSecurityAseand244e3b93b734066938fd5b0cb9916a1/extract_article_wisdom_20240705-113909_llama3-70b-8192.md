# SUMMARY
Cyber Security Asean discusses the rise of deepfake technology and its potential to make phishing attacks more sophisticated and dangerous, highlighting the need for cybersecurity awareness and education to combat these threats.

# IDEAS:
* Deepfake technology can create realistic audio or video forgeries, making it harder to distinguish between legitimate and malicious messages.
* Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated with the use of deepfakes, making it essential to educate people on cybersecurity threats and risks.
* Cybersecurity measures alone are insufficient; people need to educate themselves on deepfake technology to identify phishing attempts.
* Organisations need to assess the risk of impersonation in targeted attacks and use multiple methods of communication and verification.
* Regular cybersecurity awareness training can empower people to exercise greater vigilance when receiving suspicious emails or calls.
* A well-trained and informed workforce can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to deepfake phishing scams.
* Deepfakes can be used to scam consumers, particularly older demographics, and can cause significant financial losses.
* Online tools and tutorials are making it easy for scammers to create convincing personas in romance scams and celebrity impersonations.
