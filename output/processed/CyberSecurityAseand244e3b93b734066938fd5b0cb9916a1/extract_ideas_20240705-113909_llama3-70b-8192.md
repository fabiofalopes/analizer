* Deepfake technology can create realistic audio or video forgeries, making phishing attacks more sophisticated and dangerous.
* Phishing attacks rely on social engineering to trick victims, and deepfakes can make it harder to distinguish legitimate from malicious messages.
* Deepfakes hold exciting potential for education and entertainment, but also raise serious concerns about misinformation and scams.
* Malicious actors can exploit deepfakes to spread misinformation, damage reputations, or launch sophisticated scams.
* Deepfakes can cause significant financial losses, as seen in a Hong Kong case where an employee was tricked into transferring $25.8 million.
* Scammers use deepfakes to impersonate celebrities, promoting bogus products or scams, and targeting older demographics.
* Online tools and tutorials make it easy for scammers to map celebrity likenesses onto their webcams, blurring reality and deception.
* Deepfake cases are increasingly dominating news headlines, with no signs of slowing down.
* Open-source capabilities allow for pre-recorded deepfake generation using publicly available video footage or audio clips.
* Threat actors can use short clips to train deepfake models, but acquiring and pre-processing audio clips requires human intervention.
* Organisations need to assess the risk of impersonation in targeted attacks and use multiple methods of communication and verification.
* Executives' voices and likenesses have become part of an organisation's attack surface, requiring robust cybersecurity measures.
* Education and awareness are crucial in identifying deepfake phishing attempts and exercising vigilance during conversations.
* Regular cybersecurity awareness training can empower people to identify red flags in deepfake scams and verify with relevant parties.
* Combining strong cybersecurity measures with a well-trained and informed workforce can reduce the risk of falling victim to deepfake phishing scams.
