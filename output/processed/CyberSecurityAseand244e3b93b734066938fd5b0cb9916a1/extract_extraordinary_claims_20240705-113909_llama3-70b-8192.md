After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The text appears to be a legitimate article discussing the risks and consequences of deepfake technology and its potential use in phishing scams.

The article cites real-world examples, such as the Hong Kong case where an employee was tricked into transferring a large sum of money due to a deepfake video call, and quotes experts from reputable organizations like Kaspersky and Acronis. The article also provides information on the current state of deepfake technology and its potential risks, as well as advice on how to guard against deepfake attacks.

Since I did not find any extraordinary claims, I will not provide a list of quotes. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
