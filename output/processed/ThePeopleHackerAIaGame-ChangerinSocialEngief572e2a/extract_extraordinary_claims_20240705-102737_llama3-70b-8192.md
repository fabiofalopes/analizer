I've analyzed the article and found no extraordinary claims that meet the criteria. The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence in social engineering attacks, the importance of human awareness and education in combating these threats, and the need for a multi-faceted approach to cybersecurity. The quotes from Jenny Radcliffe, a renowned social engineering expert, are based on her expertise and do not contain any claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to list as extraordinary claims. The article presents a factual and informative discussion on the topic of AI-powered social engineering attacks and the importance of human-centered solutions to mitigate these threats.
