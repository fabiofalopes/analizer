**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Phishing emails with AI-generated content to trick employees into revealing sensitive information
* Deepfakes used to impersonate senior business leaders to defraud companies
* Targeted attacks on individuals' social media accounts to gather personal data and infiltrate companies
* Scams using AI-generated content to trick employees into performing certain actions or revealing sensitive information
* Attacks on companies' financial systems to steal money or sensitive information

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* AI-generated content is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from real content, making it a significant threat

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The use of AI-generated content and deepfakes is a significant threat to organizations, as it can be difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is AI-generated. This trend is expected to continue, making it essential for organizations to implement comprehensive cybersecurity awareness programs and technical solutions to verify the authenticity of communications. Additionally, implementing a "four eyes for everything" approach and targeted awareness programs can help prevent social media attacks and protect financial systems.

**CONCLUSION**

The use of AI-generated content and deepfakes is a significant threat to organizations, and it is essential for them to implement comprehensive cybersecurity awareness programs and technical solutions to verify the authenticity of communications. Additionally, implementing a "four eyes for everything" approach and targeted awareness programs can help prevent social media attacks and protect financial systems.
