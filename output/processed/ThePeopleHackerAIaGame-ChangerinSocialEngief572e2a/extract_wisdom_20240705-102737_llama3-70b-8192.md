* AI is being used to launch more sophisticated social engineering attacks
* Generative AI tools are being used to create realistic phishing emails and deepfakes
* AI-generated content is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from real content
* Humans are the primary target for cyber-attacks and also the main means of protecting against them
* Education and awareness programs are crucial in combatting AI-based threats
* Technical solutions like watermarks will be necessary to prevent AI-based threats

* Personal responsibility is important in avoiding scams and fraud
* AI is a game-changer in social engineering attacks
* Humans are the solution to overcoming AI-based threats
* Knowing what to look for is key to spotting AI-generated scams
* Normal people will struggle to spot AI-generated scams
* AI technology is learning and correcting mistakes all the time
* Cybercriminals are using AI to launch more sophisticated attacks

# QUOTES:
* "Unfortunately, its on the side of the criminals because its difficult to distinguish what’s real and what’s AI-generated."
* "It’s a very technical problem that can only be solved by a human solution"
* "We’re definitely seeing that chain of scams, probably because most companies have technology controls and education now."
* "One of the big issues is where do you report it and how useful is it to report it."
* "Unfortunately, there will always be a victim somewhere of criminal activity, but you can’t automatically blame banks unless it was caused by a gap in their operation."
