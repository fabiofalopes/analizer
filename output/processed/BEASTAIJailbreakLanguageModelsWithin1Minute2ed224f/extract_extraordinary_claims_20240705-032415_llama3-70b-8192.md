After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The text appears to be a factual report on a research study about jailbreaking language models and its implications for cybersecurity.

The text does not contain any statements that indicate the author is a conspiracy theorist, engaging in misinformation, or denying commonly accepted scientific truths like evolution, climate change, or the moon landing.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide in the output list. The text is a legitimate report on a research study and does not contain any extraordinary claims that require extraction.
