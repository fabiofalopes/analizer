# BEAST AI Jailbreak Language Models Within 1 Minute
## SUMMARY
Researchers from the University of Maryland developed BEAST AI, a fast and gradient-free attack that can jailbreak language models within 1 minute with high accuracy.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* Beam Search-based Adversarial Attack (BEAST)
* Gradient-free attacks
* Gradient-based attacks
* Language Models (LMs)

## TARGET AUDIENCE
* Cybersecurity researchers
* Language model developers
* Users of language models for tasks like Q&A and code generation

## OUTCOMES
* BEAST AI can jailbreak language models within 1 minute with high accuracy
* 89% success rate on Vicuna-7Bv1.5 in a minute
* Human studies show 15% more incorrect outputs and 22% irrelevant content
* BEAST excels in constrained settings for jailbreaking aligned LMs

## SOCIETAL IMPACT
* Exposes security flaws in language models, allowing for malicious activities
* Can be used to gather classified information, introduce malicious materials, and tamper with the model's authenticity
* Raises concerns about the safety and reliability of language models

## ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
* Severity: HIGH
* BEAST AI can be used for malicious purposes, such as jailbreaking language models and generating harmful content

## SUSTAINABILITY
* Environmental: NEUTRAL
* Economic: NEUTRAL
* Social: NEGATIVE (due to potential malicious uses)

## SUMMARY and RATING
* Summary: BEAST AI is a fast and gradient-free attack that can jailbreak language models within 1 minute, raising concerns about the safety and reliability of language models.
* Rating: Societal benefit - LOW, Sustainability - MEDIUM
