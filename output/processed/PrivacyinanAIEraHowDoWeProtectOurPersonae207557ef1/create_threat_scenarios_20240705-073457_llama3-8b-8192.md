Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

**Introduction**

The rise of AI and its associated technologies has brought about new challenges for privacy. As our personal information is being bought and sold, used by AI systems, and potentially repurposed without our knowledge or consent, it is essential to rethink our approach to privacy in the AI era.

**Threat Scenarios**

* AI systems pose many of the same privacy risks we've been facing during the past decades of internet commercialization and mostly unrestrained data collection.
* The risk of others using our data and AI tools for anti-social purposes, such as spear-phishing and identity theft.
* Data being repurposed for training AI systems without our knowledge or consent, potentially with direct civil rights implications.
* Biased AI systems being used to screen candidates and make hiring decisions, leading to unfair outcomes.
* Facial recognition technology being used to identify and apprehend individuals, potentially leading to false arrests and misidentification.

**Threat Model Analysis**

The AI boom has created new challenges for privacy, and it is essential to rethink our approach to data protection. The default rules and practices of data collection are not etched in stone, and we can still create a stronger regulatory system that requires users to opt-in to their data being collected or forces companies to delete data when it's being misused.

**Recommended Controls**

* Implement a shift from opt-out to opt-in data sharing, making it more seamless using software.
* Regulate AI systems to ensure that they do not collect more data than necessary for their intended purpose.
* Implement data minimization and purpose limitation regulations to prevent companies from collecting and using data for purposes other than those intended.
* Establish a supply chain approach to data privacy, ensuring that data is protected throughout its entire lifecycle.
* Consider collective solutions, such as data intermediaries, to give consumers more leverage in negotiating their data rights.

**Narrative Analysis**

The rise of AI has created new challenges for privacy, and it is essential to rethink our approach to data protection. The default rules and practices of data collection are not etched in stone, and we can still create a stronger regulatory system that requires users to opt-in to their data being collected or forces companies to delete data when it's being misused. By implementing a shift from opt-out to opt-in data sharing, regulating AI systems, and establishing a supply chain approach to data privacy, we can better protect our personal information and prevent its misuse.

**Conclusion**

The rise of AI has created new challenges for privacy, and it is essential to rethink our approach to data protection. By implementing a shift from opt-out to opt-in data sharing, regulating AI systems, and establishing a supply chain approach to data privacy, we can better protect our personal information and prevent its misuse. It is not too late to roll back the default rules and practices of data collection and create a stronger regulatory system that prioritizes individual privacy rights.

**OUTPUT**

Here is the output in Markdown format:
