This article does not describe a specific cybersecurity breach or attack. It discusses the risks of AI systems to privacy and offers potential solutions. Therefore, it does not fit the format of the requested analysis.

However, I can provide a summary of the article:

The article discusses the risks of AI systems to privacy, including the collection and use of personal data without consent, bias in AI decision-making, and the potential for AI to enable identity theft and fraud. The author, Jennifer King, argues that individual privacy rights are insufficient to address these risks and that collective solutions, such as data intermediaries, are needed to give consumers more leverage over their data rights. The article also discusses potential solutions, including opt-in data sharing, supply chain approaches to data privacy, and regulating AI systems to prevent bias and protect privacy.

If you would like, I can help you analyze a different article that describes a specific cybersecurity breach or attack.
