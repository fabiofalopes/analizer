# PATTERNS

* AI systems pose new challenges for privacy, including the risk of personal information being collected, used, and shared without consent.
* The scale of AI systems' data collection and processing makes it difficult for individuals to control their personal information.
* AI systems can be used for anti-social purposes, such as spear-phishing and identity theft.
* Personal data can be repurposed for training AI systems without consent, leading to civil rights implications.
* Predictive systems can be biased, leading to unfair outcomes, such as biased hiring practices.
* Facial recognition algorithms can be biased, leading to false arrests and misidentification.
* The default setting of opt-out data collection is problematic and should be changed to opt-in.
* Data minimization and purpose limitation regulations are necessary but may be difficult to operationalize.
* A shift to opt-in data sharing could be made more seamless using software.
* A supply chain approach to data privacy is necessary to regulate AI systems.
* The focus on individual privacy rights is too limited, and collective solutions are needed.
* Data intermediaries could provide a collective solution for consumers to negotiate for their data rights at scale.

# META

* The report analyzes the risks of AI and offers potential solutions.
* The authors, Jennifer King and Caroline Meinhardt, published a white paper titled "Rethinking Privacy in the AI Era: Policy Provocations for a Data-Centric World".
* The report highlights the need for a stronger regulatory system that requires users to opt-in to data collection.
* The authors propose a shift from opt-out to opt-in data sharing, which could be made more seamless using software.
* The report identifies the need for a collective solution to data privacy, such as data intermediaries.

# ANALYSIS
The report highlights the need for a stronger regulatory system to protect personal information in the AI era, including the need for opt-in data collection, data minimization, and purpose limitation regulations, as well as collective solutions such as data intermediaries.
