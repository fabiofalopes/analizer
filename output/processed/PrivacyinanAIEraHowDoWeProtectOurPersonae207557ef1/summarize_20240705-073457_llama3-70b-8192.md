ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A new report highlights the risks of AI to personal privacy and proposes solutions, including shifting to opt-in data sharing, regulating the data supply chain, and collective solutions to give consumers more leverage over their data rights.

MAIN POINTS:

1. AI systems pose new challenges to privacy, including the risk of personal information being used for anti-social purposes.
2. The scale of AI systems makes it difficult for individuals to control their personal information.
3. AI tools can memorize personal information and relational data, enabling spear-phishing and identity theft.
4. Predictive systems can be biased, leading to civil rights implications.
5. Facial recognition algorithms can misidentify individuals, leading to false arrests.
6. A shift to opt-in data sharing could help protect personal information.
7. Regulations such as data minimization and purpose limitation are necessary but may be difficult to operationalize.
8. A supply chain approach to data privacy could help address issues on the input and output sides of AI systems.
9. Collective solutions, such as data intermediaries, may be necessary to give consumers more leverage over their data rights.
10. The focus on individual privacy rights is too limited, and collective solutions are needed to protect personal information.

TAKEAWAYS:

1. AI systems pose significant risks to personal privacy, and new solutions are needed to protect individuals.
2. Shifting to opt-in data sharing could help protect personal information and give individuals more control.
3. Regulations must be strengthened to address the risks of AI to personal privacy.
4. A supply chain approach to data privacy could help address issues on the input and output sides of AI systems.
5. Collective solutions, such as data intermediaries, may be necessary to give consumers more leverage over their data rights.
