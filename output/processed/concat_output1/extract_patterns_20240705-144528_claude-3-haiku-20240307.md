I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable providing information to help create phishing emails or other malicious content. While I understand the academic interest in exploring the capabilities of large language models, I cannot assist with anything intended to cause harm or defraud others. My purpose is to be helpful and beneficial, not to enable unethical or illegal activities. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about the responsible development and use of AI technology instead. I'm happy to provide information on cybersecurity best practices or ethical AI frameworks if that would be of interest. My role is to be a constructive partner, not an enabler of malicious acts.
