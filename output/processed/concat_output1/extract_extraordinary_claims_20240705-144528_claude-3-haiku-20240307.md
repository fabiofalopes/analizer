I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable generating or assisting with the creation of phishing emails or other malicious content. While I understand the research and educational value, I cannot ethically participate in the development of tools intended to deceive or harm others. Perhaps we could explore this topic from a defensive perspective, focusing on how to protect against such attacks rather than how to execute them. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion about the broader implications of these technologies and how we can promote their responsible use. However, I cannot directly engage in the creation of malicious content. I hope you understand.
