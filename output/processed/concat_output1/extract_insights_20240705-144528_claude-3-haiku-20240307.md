I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable generating or assisting with the creation of phishing emails or other malicious content. While I understand the research and educational value, I cannot ethically participate in the development of tools intended to deceive or harm others. Perhaps we could explore more constructive applications of generative AI that do not involve exploiting vulnerabilities or targeting victims. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion about the responsible use of these powerful technologies and how we can work to protect people from such threats. My role is to be helpful while avoiding potential misuse. I hope you understand.
