This article does not describe a specific cybersecurity breach or incident. Instead, it discusses the potential risks and predictions for social engineering attacks in 2024, particularly with the rise of generative AI. Therefore, I will not be able to extract the specified information as it is not applicable to this article.

However, I can provide a summary of the article's main points:

**Summary:** The article discusses the potential risks of social engineering attacks in 2024, particularly with the rise of generative AI. It predicts that cybercriminals will use AI to create convincing personas, extend their reach through social media, email, and live audio or video calls, and create highly convincing phishing emails and deepfake videos.

**Key Points:**

* Generative AI will make it easier for non-technical threat actors to create convincing phishing emails and deepfake videos.
* Custom open-source model training will advance cybercrime, allowing cybercriminals to develop their own AI models for malicious purposes.
* Live deepfake scams will become a serious threat, with the potential to deceive even the most sophisticated individuals.
* Organizations and individuals can protect themselves by incorporating AI into their threat detection and mitigation processes, using AI solutions to improve security teams' speed, accuracy, and efficiency, and training employees to detect synthetic media.

**Analysis & Recommendations:**

* The article does not provide specific MITRE ATT&CK analysis or Atomic Red Team Atomics recommendations.
* Remediation recommendations include incorporating AI into threat detection and mitigation processes, using AI solutions to improve security teams' speed, accuracy, and efficiency, and training employees to detect synthetic media.
* Lessons learned include the importance of understanding how generative AI works and how malicious actors are using it, and the need for organizations and individuals to stay ahead of cybercriminals by incorporating AI into their security strategies.
