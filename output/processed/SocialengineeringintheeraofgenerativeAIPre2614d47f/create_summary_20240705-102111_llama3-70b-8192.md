# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Generative AI is driving an arms race between cybersecurity and social engineering scammers, who are using AI to create convincing attacks and misinformation at scale.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) are driving an arms race between cybersecurity and social engineering scammers.
2. Generative AI is both a curse and an opportunity for businesses, as it brings new cyber risks while offering potential benefits.
3. Cyber criminals are using AI to create convincing social engineering attacks, including phishing emails and deepfake videos.
4. Technical expertise is no longer a barrier to entry for cyber criminals, thanks to the democratization of AI and data.
5. Custom open-source model training will advance cyber crime, as open-source LLMs can be customized and unleashed from arbitrary constraints.
6. Live deepfake scams will become a serious threat, as generative AI advances and computing requirements decrease.
7. Organizations and individuals can protect themselves by incorporating AI into their threat detection and mitigation processes.
8. AI solutions can assist infosec teams in operations like malware analysis, phishing detection, and threat simulation and training.
9. Red-teaming and offensive security can help infosec professionals stay ahead of cyber criminals.
10. Understanding how generative AI works and how malicious actors are using it can help businesses train employees to detect synthetic media.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. Generative AI is a game-changer for social engineering attacks, making them more convincing and widespread.
2. Cyber criminals are leveraging AI to create highly convincing personas and extend their reach through social media, email, and live audio or video calls.
3. The democratization of AI and data has lowered the barrier to entry for cyber criminals, making it easier for non-technical threat actors to join the fray.
4. Custom open-source model training will accelerate cyber crime, as open-source LLMs can be customized and unleashed from arbitrary constraints.
5. Live deepfake scams will become a serious threat, as generative AI advances and computing requirements decrease.
