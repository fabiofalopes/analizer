**ARGUMENT SUMMARY:** The article predicts that social engineering attacks will increase in 2024 due to the advancements in generative AI, making it easier for cybercriminals to create convincing phishing emails, profiles, and deepfake videos.

**TRUTH CLAIMS:**

**CLAIM 1:** Breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) are driving an arms race between cybersecurity and social engineering scammers.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:** 
* The article cites the democratization of AI and data, making it easier for non-technical threat actors to join the fray.
* It mentions the development of open-source models, such as Stable Diffusion for image synthesis and GPT4ALL for text generation, which can be customized and used for malicious purposes.

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** 
* None provided.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** 
* None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** B (High)

**LABELS:** 
* Specious (the article assumes that the advancements in generative AI will directly lead to an increase in social engineering attacks without providing concrete evidence)

**CLAIM 2:** Cybercriminals can create highly convincing personas and extend their reach through social media, email, and even live audio or video calls using generative AI.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:** 
* The article cites the ability of generative AI to create convincing phishing emails, profile images, and deepfake videos.
* It mentions the development of custom open-source models, such as WormGPT and FraudGPT, which can be used for malicious purposes.

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** 
* None provided.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** 
* None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** A (Definitely True)

**LABELS:** 
* None

**CLAIM 3:** Technical expertise will no longer be a barrier to entry for cybercriminals due to the democratization of AI and data.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:** 
* The article cites the development of open-source models, such as Stable Diffusion for image synthesis and GPT4ALL for text generation, which can be customized and used for malicious purposes.
* It mentions the ability of non-technical threat actors to use generative AI to create convincing phishing emails and profiles.

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** 
* None provided.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** 
* None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** A (Definitely True)

**LABELS:** 
* None

**CLAIM 4:** Live deepfake scams will become a serious threat in 2024.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:** 
* The article cites a recent report that found a 3,000% increase in deepfake fraud attempts in 2023.
* It mentions the ability of generative AI to create convincing deepfake videos, such as the one used in a $25 million scam in Hong Kong.

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** 
* None provided.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** 
* None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** A (Definitely True)

**LABELS:** 
* None

**OVERALL SCORE:**

LOWEST CLAIM SCORE: B (High)
HIGHEST CLAIM SCORE: A (Definitely True)
AVERAGE CLAIM SCORE: A (Definitely True)

**OVERALL ANALYSIS:** The article provides a well-researched and balanced view of the potential risks and consequences of generative AI in social engineering attacks. While some claims may be speculative, the evidence provided supports the overall argument that generative AI will increase the sophistication and effectiveness of social engineering attacks. The article's recommendations for incorporating AI into threat detection and mitigation processes are also well-supported.
