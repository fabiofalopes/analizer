Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay that predicts the future of social engineering in the era of generative AI. Here is the output:

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Technical expertise will no longer be a barrier to entry for cyber criminals, as generative AI democratizes the creation of convincing phishing emails and malicious scripts.
* Custom open-source model training will advance cyber crime, allowing non-technical threat actors to create their own AI-powered attacks.
* Live deepfake scams will become a serious threat, as AI-generated videos and audio recordings become increasingly convincing and difficult to detect.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The rise of generative AI has created a new era of social engineering, where cyber criminals can create convincing personas and extend their reach through social media, email, and live audio or video calls.
* The democratization of AI has made it easier for non-technical threat actors to join the fray, creating a new generation of cyber criminals.
* The increasing sophistication of AI-generated content, including deepfakes and personalized phishing emails, will make it harder for individuals and organizations to detect and prevent attacks.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement AI-powered threat detection and mitigation processes to stay ahead of cyber criminals.
* Train employees to detect synthetic media and understand how generative AI is used in social engineering attacks.
* Use red-teaming and offensive security techniques to stay a step ahead of cyber criminals.
* Incorporate AI solutions into security teams to improve speed, accuracy, and efficiency.

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

* The rise of generative AI has created a new era of social engineering, where cyber criminals can create convincing personas and extend their reach through social media, email, and live audio or video calls.
* The democratization of AI has made it easier for non-technical threat actors to join the fray, creating a new generation of cyber criminals.
* The increasing sophistication of AI-generated content, including deepfakes and personalized phishing emails, will make it harder for individuals and organizations to detect and prevent attacks.

**CONCLUSION**

As generative AI continues to advance, it is essential for individuals and organizations to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to the new era of social engineering. By incorporating AI-powered threat detection and mitigation processes, training employees to detect synthetic media, and using red-teaming and offensive security techniques, we can stay a step ahead of cyber criminals and protect ourselves against the rising tide of fakery.
