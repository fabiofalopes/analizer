Here is a summary of the key points from the report:

ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Experts are doubtful that ethical AI design will be broadly adopted as the norm within the next decade.

MAIN POINTS:
1. It is difficult to define what constitutes "ethical" AI, as there is no consensus on ethical principles.
2. Humans are the problem - whose ethics should be applied, who decides, who cares, and who enforces ethical AI?
3. AI can be used for both good and ill, making standards-setting a challenge.
4. Further AI evolution itself raises new questions and complications around ethics.
5. Control of AI is concentrated in the hands of powerful companies and governments driven by profit and power motives.
6. Global competition, especially between China and the U.S., will matter more to AI development than ethical concerns.

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Ethical AI is difficult to define and implement due to lack of consensus on ethical principles.
2. Powerful actors are more focused on profit and control than ethics when developing AI.
3. Quantum computing is unlikely to significantly assist in creating ethical AI systems in the next decade.
4. Some experts are hopeful that progress will be made as AI becomes more embedded in society, but many are skeptical of broad adoption of ethical AI design.
5. Ensuring AI serves the public good will require significant shifts in values, regulations, and power dynamics.
