Here are the key points from the report:

Experts' Views on the Future of Ethical AI Design:

- 68% of experts said ethical principles focused on the public good will NOT be employed in most AI systems by 2030.
- 32% said ethical principles focused on the public good WILL be employed in most AI systems by 2030.

Experts' Concerns About AI Being Used in Questionable Ways:

- Many experts said it will be difficult to define and implement ethical standards for AI due to challenges like:
  - Lack of consensus on what constitutes "ethical" behavior
  - Difficulty enforcing ethical principles, especially with bad actors
  - Profit motives and global competition driving unethical uses of AI
- Experts worried about AI being used for surveillance, manipulation, and amplifying existing biases and inequalities.

Experts' Hopes for Ethical AI Development:

- Some experts were optimistic that ethical AI will evolve as the technology matures, social pressures mount, and a new generation of ethically-trained technologists emerge.
- Experts said AI could bring benefits in areas like healthcare, scientific research, and transportation if designed responsibly.
- A few experts speculated that quantum computing could assist in building more ethical AI systems, but many were skeptical of this possibility in the next decade.

Overall, the report paints a mixed picture, with most experts doubtful that ethical AI will be the norm within the next 10 years, but some seeing reasons for hope if concerted efforts are made to steer the technology in a positive direction.
