After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article reports on a real event involving deepfake technology and a scam, and it does not contain any quotes or statements that promote misinformation or conspiracy theories.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to output as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
