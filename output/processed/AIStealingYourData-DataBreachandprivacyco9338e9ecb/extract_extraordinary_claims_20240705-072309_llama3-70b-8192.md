* "90% of people are not aware that their commands to all of these AI – Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, etc. – are being recorded" - Ajoy Singh, COO and Head of AI, Fractal Analytics (implies that AI assistants are constantly recording conversations without consent)

* "AI technology should not be used to train humans where there is a potential risk to life or where the cost of error is huge." - Ajoy Singh, COO and Head of AI, Fractal Analytics (implies that AI technology can be used to train humans in high-stakes situations)
