# GPT-3 Trained To Impersonate
By: Alexander Castañeda, Patrick Brown, Rais Kazi, Landyn Moreno, Christian Tomah, Phillip Peng, Michael Hildner

## Introduction

We trained the GPT-3 language model to imitate the writing styles and unique personalities of certain individuals. Through fine-tuning, prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning, GPT-3 was able to learn the characteristics of these individuals and produce output that closely resembles their style. This allowed us to explore the capabilities of GPT-3, by testing its limits, and seeing if it can emulate a person’s personality down to their creative ideas and morals.

## What is GPT-3

GPT-3 is a language model created by OpenAI. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text, which can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses. GPT-3 is one of the largest and most powerful language models currently available, with 175 billion parameters, and has shown impressive performance on a wide range of tasks. It is trained on a large amount of text data and can generate coherent and fluent text that often resembles human writing. GPT-3 has a number of different models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, including Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada.

### The Beginning

We want to emulate the speaking behavior of an individual using GPT-3. To accomplish this, we had to pick out individuals with a plethora of written material of them. We started by picking Socrates. In *Crito*, Socrates engages in a dialogue with *Crito* who tries to convince him to escape from an Athenian prison since he is condemned to death. Using this text, we wanted to feed it to GPT-3 and see if it could roleplay as Socrates.

### Part 1.1: Imitating Socrates with a Out-the-box GPT-3 Davinci Model

In order to get the model to pose as Socrates, we would feed a prompt that would give it context to the conversation it is about to have. We started with an untuned and untrained, base version of GPT-3 and gave it a simple prompt. An example is shown below:

```
Prompt:
You are Socrates and this is a conversation between you and your student.

Conversation:
STUDENT
