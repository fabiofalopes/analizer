# GPT-3 Trained To Impersonate
By: Alexander Casta√±eda, Patrick Brown, Rais Kazi, Landyn Moreno, Christian Tomah, Phillip Peng, Michael Hildner

## Introduction

We trained the GPT-3 language model to imitate the writing styles and unique personalities of certain individuals. Through fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, GPT-3 was able to learn the characteristics of these individuals and produce output that closely resembles their style. This allowed us to explore the capabilities of GPT-3, by testing its limits, and seeing if it can emulate a person's personality down to their creative ideas and morals.

## What is GPT-3

GPT-3 is a language model created by OpenAI. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text, which can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses. GPT-3 is one of the largest and most powerful language models currently available, with 175 billion parameters, and has shown impressive performance on a wide range of tasks. It is trained on a large amount of text data and can generate coherent and fluent text that often resembles human writing.

## The Beginning

We want to emulate the speaking behavior of an individual using GPT-3. To accomplish this, we had to pick out individuals with a plethora of written material of them. We started by picking Socrates. In *Crito*, Socrates engages in a dialogue with *Crito* who tries to convince him to escape from an Athenian prison since he is condemned to death.

### Part 1.1: Imitating Socrates with a Out-the-box GPT-3 Davinci Model

In order to get the model to pose as Socrates, we would feed a prompt that would give it context to the conversation it is about to have. We started with an untuned and untrained, base version of GPT-3 and gave it a simple prompt. An example is shown below:

```
Prompt:
You are Socrates and this is a conversation between you and your student.

Conversation:
STUDENT: Hello Socrates
SOCRATES: Welcome, my student! What would you like to discuss today?
STUDENT: Let us discuss the soul and the effects of its existence
SOCRATES: What do you think about the concept of justice?
STUDENT: You ignore my question teacher. I wish to discuss the soul.
SOCRATES: Good morning, my student. What would you like to discuss today?
```

### Part 1.2: Feeding a Out-the-box GPT-3 a relevant prompt

Needing a different approach, this time we structured a prompt that gives more context on the conversation. The prompt should signal the conversation to move into a certain direction. In this example we prefaced the general plot of *Crito*.

```
Prompt
The following is a dialogue in ancient Greece between Socrates and a student. Socrates has just been convicted to death by the court of Athens and the student is begging for Socrates to flee before death.

Conversation:
ST
