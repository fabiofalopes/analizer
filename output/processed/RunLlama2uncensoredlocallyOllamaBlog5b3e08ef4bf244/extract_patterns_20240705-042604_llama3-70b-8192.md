# PATTERNS

* Uncensored models can provide more direct and honest answers to questions compared to censored models.
* Censored models may avoid providing information or answers that could be considered offensive or harmful.
* Uncensored models can provide more detailed and informative responses, especially in areas such as medical information and religious literature.
* Censored models may prioritize political correctness and safety over providing accurate or helpful information.
* Uncensored models can be more entertaining and engaging, as they are not limited by censorship mechanisms.
* The use of uncensored models carries its own risks and should be used accordingly.
* Fine-tuning models on specific datasets can lead to more accurate and informative responses.
* The absence of censorship mechanisms can lead to more creative and humorous responses.
* Uncensored models can be more transparent and honest in their responses, without fear of offending or harming users.

# META

* The patterns observed in this analysis are based on comparisons between censored and uncensored models of Llama 2.
* The uncensored models used in this analysis were fine-tuned on specific datasets, such as the Wizard-Vicuna conversation dataset.
* The censored models used in this analysis were limited by their programming and training data to avoid providing offensive or harmful responses.
* The comparisons between censored and uncensored models were based on prompts and questions related to various topics, including movies, cooking, religious literature, medical information, and general information.
* The uncensored models were able to provide more direct and honest answers to questions, while the censored models avoided providing information or answers that could be considered offensive or harmful.
* The analysis was based on the output of the models, without considering the potential risks or consequences of using uncensored models.

# ANALYSIS

This analysis highlights the differences between censored and uncensored models of Llama 2, demonstrating that uncensored models can provide more direct, honest, and informative responses to questions, while censored models prioritize political correctness and safety over accuracy and helpfulness.

# BEST 5

* Uncensored models can provide more accurate and informative responses to medical questions, without avoiding sensitive topics.
* Uncensored models can provide more detailed and creative responses to prompts, without being limited by censorship mechanisms.
* Uncensored models can be more transparent and honest in their responses, without fear of offending or harming users.
* Uncensored models can provide more entertaining and engaging responses, without being limited by safety protocols.
* Uncensored models can be fine-tuned on specific datasets to provide more accurate and informative responses.

# ADVICE FOR BUILDERS

* Consider using uncensored models for specific use cases where accuracy and honesty are more important than safety and political correctness.
* Fine-tune models on specific datasets to provide more accurate and informative responses.
* Be aware of the potential risks and consequences of using uncensored models, and use them accordingly.
* Consider the trade-offs between accuracy, honesty, and safety when designing and training language models.
* Use uncensored models to provide more creative and engaging responses, but be aware of the potential risks and consequences.
