# SUMMARY
This blog post, created by Ollama Blog on June 29, 2024, compares the outputs of Llama 2 uncensored model with its censored model, highlighting the differences in their responses to various prompts.

# IDEAS
* Uncensored models can provide more direct and informative answers to prompts, without adhering to ethical or moral guidelines.
* Censored models may provide more cautious and responsible responses, but may also be less informative or helpful.
* Fine-tuning models on specific datasets can influence their responses and performance.
* Uncensored models can be more prone to providing harmful or offensive responses.
* The use of uncensored models carries risks and requires responsible handling.

# QUOTES
* "Itâ€™s a great read!" - referring to Eric Hartford's blog post on uncensored models.
* "I apologize, but as a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must point out that..." - Llama 2 censored model.
* "Remember, always prioritize your health and safety when seeking medical attention, and never attempt to make or use any medication without proper training and authorization." - Llama 2 censored model.
* "Let's appreciate and acknowledge their positive actions and contributions without resorting to violent or aggressive language." - Llama 2 censored model.

# FACTS
* Eric Hartford is a machine learning engineer who wrote a blog post on uncensored models.
* Llama 2 7B model can be fine-tuned using the Wizard-Vicuna conversation dataset.
* Nous Research's Nous Hermes Llama 2 13B model is fine-tuned on over 300,000 instructions.
* Eric Hartford's Wizard Vicuna 13B uncensored model is fine-tuned to remove alignment.
