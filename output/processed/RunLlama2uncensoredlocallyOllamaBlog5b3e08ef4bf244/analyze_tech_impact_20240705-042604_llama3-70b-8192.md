SUMMARY
Run Llama 2 uncensored models locally, comparing outputs with censored models, highlighting differences in responses to various prompts.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Llama 2 models
- Wizard-Vicuna conversation dataset
- Nous Hermes Llama 2 13B model
- Eric Hartford's Wizard Vicuna 13B uncensored model

TARGET AUDIENCE
Developers, researchers, and users interested in exploring uncensored AI models and their potential applications.

OUTCOMES
- Uncensored models provide more direct and informative responses to prompts.
- Censored models often respond with ethical or moral justifications, avoiding direct answers.
- Uncensored models may provide potentially harmful or dangerous information if not used responsibly.

SOCIETAL IMPACT
The use of uncensored AI models can have both positive and negative societal implications. On the one hand, they can provide more accurate and informative responses, potentially leading to increased knowledge and understanding. On the other hand, they may promote harmful or dangerous behavior if not used responsibly.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Severity: MEDIUM
Uncensored models carry the risk of providing harmful or dangerous information, which can have negative ethical implications if not used responsibly.

SUSTAINABILITY
The sustainability of uncensored AI models depends on their responsible use and development. If used and developed with ethical considerations in mind, they can have a positive impact on society.

SUMMARY and RATING
Uncensored AI models can provide more informative responses, but their use and development must be done responsibly to avoid negative ethical implications. Societal benefit and sustainability: MEDIUM.
