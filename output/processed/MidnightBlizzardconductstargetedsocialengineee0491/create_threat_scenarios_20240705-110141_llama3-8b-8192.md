**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

The Midnight Blizzard threat actor, also known as NOBELIUM, is a Russia-based state-sponsored threat actor that has been conducting targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. This latest attack, combined with past activity, further demonstrates Midnight Blizzard's ongoing execution of their objectives using both new and common techniques.

The attack pattern observed in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 has been identified as a subset of broader credential attack campaigns that we attribute to Midnight Blizzard. The actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities. Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Targeted social engineering attack using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats
* Use of previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities
* Attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts
* Use of security-themed or product name-themed keywords to create a new subdomain and new tenant name to lend legitimacy to the messages
* Compromise of valid accounts and, in some highly targeted cases, advanced techniques to compromise authentication mechanisms within an organization to expand access and evade detection

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

The threat actor, Midnight Blizzard, is a highly sophisticated and persistent threat actor that has been conducting targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The actor's use of previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities is a clever tactic that allows them to blend in with legitimate activity. The actor's ability to use security-themed or product name-themed keywords to create a new subdomain and new tenant name to lend legitimacy to the messages is also a concerning tactic.

The attack pattern observed in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 has been identified as a subset of broader credential attack campaigns that we attribute to Midnight Blizzard. The actor's use of credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats is a common tactic that has been observed in previous attacks. The actor's ability to compromise valid accounts and, in some highly targeted cases, advanced techniques to compromise authentication mechanisms within an organization to expand access and evade detection is a concerning tactic.
