**SUMMARY**
Microsoft Security Blog discusses Midnight Blizzard's targeted social engineering attacks on Microsoft Teams, using credential theft phishing lures to steal credentials from organizations.

**IDEAS**
* Midnight Blizzard uses compromised Microsoft 365 tenants to create new domains that appear as technical support entities.
* The threat actor sends lures that attempt to steal credentials from targeted organizations by engaging users and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts.
* The attack has affected fewer than 40 unique global organizations, primarily in government, non-government organizations, IT services, technology, discrete manufacturing, and media sectors.
* Midnight Blizzard is a Russia-based threat actor attributed to the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation.
* The threat actor is known to primarily target governments, diplomatic entities, non-government organizations, and IT service providers.
* Midnight Blizzard utilizes diverse initial access methods, including stolen credentials, supply chain attacks, and exploitation of on-premises environments.
* The threat actor is tracked by partner security vendors as APT29, UNC2452, and Cozy Bear.
* Microsoft recommends mitigations, including piloting phishing-resistant authentication methods, implementing Conditional Access authentication strength, and applying security best practices for Microsoft Teams.
* Users should be educated about social engineering and credential phishing attacks, and should review sign-in activity and mark suspicious sign-in attempts as “This wasn’t me”.

**INSIGHTS**
* Midnight Blizzard's attacks demonstrate the importance of security best practices and user education in preventing credential theft.
* The threat actor's use of compromised Microsoft 365 tenants highlights the need for organizations to monitor and secure their cloud environments.
* The attack's focus on government, non-government organizations, and IT service providers underscores the importance of protecting sensitive information and systems.
* Microsoft's recommendations for mitigations emphasize the need for a multi-layered approach to security, including phishing-resistant authentication methods and Conditional Access authentication strength.

**QUOTES**
* "We encourage organizations to reinforce security best practices to all users and reinforce that any authentication requests not initiated by the user should be treated as malicious."
* "Midnight Blizzard is consistent and persistent in their operational targeting, and their objectives rarely change."

**HABITS**
* Educate users about social engineering and credential phishing attacks.
* Review sign-in activity and mark suspicious sign-in attempts as “This wasn’t me”.
* Implement security best practices for Microsoft Teams, including specifying trusted Microsoft 365 organizations and allowing only known devices that adhere to Microsoft’s recommended security baselines.

**FACTS**
* Midnight Blizzard is a Russia-based threat actor attributed to the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation.
* The threat actor has been active since at least early 2018.
* Midnight Blizzard is tracked by partner security vendors as APT29, UNC2452, and Cozy Bear.
* The attack has affected fewer than 40 unique global organizations.

**REFERENCES**
* Microsoft Threat Intelligence Blog
* Microsoft Purview
* Microsoft Sentinel
* Azure portal sign-in from another Azure tenant
* Successful sign-in from non-compliant device
* User accounts – Sign-in failure due to CA spikes
* New onmicrosoft domain added to tenant

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Midnight Blizzard's targeted social engineering attacks on Microsoft Teams highlight the importance of security best practices, user education, and multi-layered security approaches to prevent credential theft.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Pilot and start deploying phishing-resistant authentication methods for users.
* Implement Conditional Access authentication strength to require phishing-resistant authentication for employees and external users for critical apps.
* Apply security best practices for Microsoft Teams, including specifying trusted Microsoft 365 organizations and allowing only known devices that adhere to Microsoft’s recommended security baselines.
* Educate users about social engineering and credential phishing attacks, and review sign-in activity and mark suspicious sign-in attempts as “This wasn’t me”.
