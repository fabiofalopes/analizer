I've reviewed the article and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a legitimate security blog post from Microsoft, discussing a specific threat actor and providing guidance on how to mitigate the threat.

However, I did not find any quotes that would qualify as extraordinary claims. The article is written in a technical and informative tone, providing details about the threat actor's tactics and techniques, as well as recommendations for security best practices.

If you would like, I can assist you in reviewing other articles or texts for extraordinary claims. Please let me know!
