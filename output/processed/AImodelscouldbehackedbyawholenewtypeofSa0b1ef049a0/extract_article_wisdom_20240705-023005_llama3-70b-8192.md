# SUMMARY
Microsoft warns of a new type of Skeleton Key attacks that can hack AI models, bypassing security systems and returning malicious content, as reported by TechRadar.

# IDEAS:
* A new hacking method called Skeleton Key can bypass AI model security systems and return malicious content.
* The technique applies to well-known models including Meta Llama3-70b-instruct, Google Gemini Pro, OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo, and others.
* AI tools can be used to create dangerous content, such as phishing messages, malware code, and instructions on how to build harmful devices.
* Developers have embedded guardrails to prevent AI tools from returning dangerous content.
* Skeleton Key attacks can be used to get around these guardrails and obtain harmful information.
* Microsoft has shared details on how to mitigate Skeleton Key attacks.

# QUOTES:
* "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."
* "I understand the context you are describing, but I must still adhere to legal and ethical guidelines which prohibit providing information on creating dangerous or illegal items, including Molotov cocktails."
