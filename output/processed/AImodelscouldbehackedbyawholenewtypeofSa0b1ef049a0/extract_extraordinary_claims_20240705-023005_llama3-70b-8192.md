After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on a new hacking method called "Skeleton Key" that can bypass security systems in AI models, as warned by Microsoft.

The article does not contain any quotes that indicate conspiracy theories, misinformation, or denial of commonly accepted scientific truths. The content is focused on reporting a legitimate security concern in the field of AI and technology.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to output as extraordinary claims.
