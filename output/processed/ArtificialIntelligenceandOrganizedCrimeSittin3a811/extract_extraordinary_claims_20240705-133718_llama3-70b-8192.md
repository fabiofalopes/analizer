After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a well-researched and informative piece on the topic of artificial intelligence and organized crime, specifically the Yahoo Boys.

The article presents facts and information about the Yahoo Boys' activities, the use of AI in social engineering scams, and tips for protecting oneself from these scams. The language is clear, and the author provides evidence and references to support their claims.

I did not find any quotes that indicate the author is a conspiracy theorist, engaging in misinformation, or denying commonly accepted scientific truths. The article is focused on presenting information and raising awareness about the issue of AI-powered social engineering scams.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
