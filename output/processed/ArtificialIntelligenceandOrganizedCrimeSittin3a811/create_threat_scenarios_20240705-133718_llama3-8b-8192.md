Based on the input, I will create a threat model essay and output the following sections:

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* A Yahoo Boy group member uses AI-generated phishing emails to trick a victim into revealing sensitive information.
* A scammer uses voice cloning to impersonate a trusted individual and trick a victim into transferring funds.
* A deepfake video is used to impersonate a victim's boss, requesting sensitive information or financial transactions.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The Yahoo Boys are a decentralized collective of individual scammers and clusters operating across West Africa, using social media platforms to share scamming techniques, scripts, and resources.
* AI is being exploited by cybercriminals to automate and enhance various aspects of social engineering scams, including natural language generation, voice cloning, deepfakes, sentiment analysis, and target profiling.
* The scams themselves are getting more psychologically manipulative and technologically advanced, incorporating live deepfake video calls, AI-generated explicit images, and physical gifts to build trust with victims.
* The rise in sextortion schemes is a particularly disturbing trend, with cases linked to dozens of suicides by traumatized victims.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement robust security measures, such as email filtering, web content filtering, and endpoint protection, to detect and block potential threats.
* Enable multi-factor authentication for accounts and devices to add an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
* Keep software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
* Educate yourself and stay informed about the latest AI-powered social engineering techniques and scams.
* Implement cybersecurity awareness training to educate employees about threats, best practices, and their role in protecting company data and systems.
