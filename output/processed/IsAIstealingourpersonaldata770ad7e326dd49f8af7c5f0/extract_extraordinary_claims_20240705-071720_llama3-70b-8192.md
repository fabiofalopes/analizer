I've analyzed the article and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a well-researched and balanced discussion on the topic of AI and personal data privacy, highlighting the importance of responsible AI development, data privacy, and ethical considerations.

However, I can provide you with a list of quotes that may be relevant to the topic of AI and data privacy:

* "AI algorithms crave data as they hunger for it, constantly seeking new sources of information to refine their capabilities."
* "This hunger for data has raised eyebrows, as it often involves collecting and processing personal information from users, sometimes without their explicit consent."
* "Many users are unaware that their personal data is being collected and used to train AI models, raising ethical questions about tech companiesâ€™ practices."
* "Experts argue that companies should be more transparent about their data collection practices and seek explicit consent from users before using their personal information for AI training or other purposes."
* "AI systems should be designed and trained with ethical principles in mind, ensuring that personal data is handled securely and used only for legitimate purposes."
* "Users should have control over their personal data and the ability to make informed decisions about how it is used."
* "Tech companies can empower users by providing transparent privacy policies, clear opt-out mechanisms, and tools to manage and delete their data."

Please note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather a summary of the article's discussion on AI and data privacy.
