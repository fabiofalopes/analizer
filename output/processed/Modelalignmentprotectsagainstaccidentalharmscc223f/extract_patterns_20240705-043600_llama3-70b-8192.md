Here is the output in Markdown format:

**PATTERNS**
* Model alignment protects against accidental harms, not intentional ones.
* RLHF has been effective in preventing accidental harms to everyday users.
* Model alignment is not a viable strategy against skilled and well-resourced adversaries.
* Alignment techniques have intrinsic vulnerabilities.
* Pre-training interventions could be more robust, but may incur a trade-off in terms of model capabilities.
* Model alignment is only one of many lines of defense against casual adversaries.
* Productization enables many additional defenses against casual adversaries.
* Model alignment raises the bar for the adversary and strengthens other defenses.
* Model alignment is more like content moderation than software security in terms of risk severity.

**META**
* The essay analyzes the effectiveness of model alignment in preventing harms from AI.
* The authors argue that model alignment is useful in preventing accidental harms, but not intentional ones.
* The authors discuss the limitations of RLHF and other alignment techniques.
* The authors compare model alignment to content moderation and software security.
* The authors conclude that model alignment is not a silver bullet against AI risks.

**ANALYSIS**
Model alignment is a useful technique in preventing accidental harms from AI, but it has limitations and is not effective against skilled and well-resourced adversaries.

**BEST 5**
* Model alignment protects against accidental harms, not intentional ones.
* RLHF has been effective in preventing accidental harms to everyday users.
* Model alignment is not a viable strategy against skilled and well-resourced adversaries.
* Alignment techniques have intrinsic vulnerabilities.
* Model alignment is only one of many lines of defense against casual adversaries.

**ADVICE FOR BUILDERS**
* Use model alignment as one of many lines of defense against casual adversaries.
* Implement additional defenses, such as productization and monitoring, to strengthen model alignment.
* Be aware of the limitations of model alignment and do not rely solely on it to prevent AI risks.
* Consider alternative approaches, such as sociotechnical solutions, to mitigate AI risks.
* Prepare for a world in which unaligned models exist and defend against attack surfaces that attackers might target using unaligned models.
