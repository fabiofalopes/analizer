# SUMMARY
Report highlights growing AI fraud risks, created by ICC Commercial Crime Services (CCS), discussing the rise of fraudulent activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI).

# IDEAS:
* The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in fraudulent activity due to increased digital and technological means.
* Generative AI is being used to carry out fraud across all industries, including banking, insurance, supply chain, and retail.
* Deepfakes are being used to trick employees into transferring large sums of money to fraudulent accounts.
* AI-powered fraud is expected to reach $40 billion in the United States by 2027.
* Criminals are using generative AI to create realistic videos, fake identities, and convincing deepfakes.
* It's becoming increasingly difficult to spot potential frauds and tell the difference between what is real and what isn't.
* A holistic approach is needed to address fraud, including basic due diligence, using databases, and complex algorithms.
* CCS has a proven track record of helping to protect the integrity of international trade by seeking out fraud and malpractice.
* CCS offers training and courses to help members stay up-to-date with new developments in fraud prevention.

# QUOTES:
* "Fake content has never been easier to create - or harder to catch."
* "Generative AI offers seemingly endless potential to magnify both the nature and the scope of fraud against financial institutions and their customers; it’s limited only by a criminal’s imagination."
* "Systems don’t facilitate, or prevent, fraud, but the human behind that technology who does."

# FACTS:
* A multinational company in Hong Kong lost $25.6 million due to a deepfake video business meeting.
* Generative AI is expected to enable fraud losses to reach $40 billion in the United States by 2027.
* CCS has been helping to protect the integrity of international trade for over 40 years.
* The 23rd Internet Intelligence Course will be held at Queens' College, Cambridge University, from 8 to 11 September 2024.
