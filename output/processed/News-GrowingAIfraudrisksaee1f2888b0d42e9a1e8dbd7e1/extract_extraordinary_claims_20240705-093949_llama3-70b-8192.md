After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The text appears to be a factual report on the growing risks of AI fraud and the importance of addressing it through a holistic approach.

The text does not contain any statements that indicate the author is a conspiracy theorist, engaging in misinformation, or denying commonly accepted scientific truths such as evolution, climate change, or the moon landing.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to output as there are no extraordinary claims made in the text.
