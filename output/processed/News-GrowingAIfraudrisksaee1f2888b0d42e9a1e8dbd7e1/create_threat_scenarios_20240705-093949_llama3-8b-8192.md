Based on the input, I will create a threat model essay and output the recommended controls, threat scenarios, and narrative analysis.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

The growing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a significant increase in fraudulent activities across various industries, including banking, insurance, supply chain, and retail. The emergence of deepfakes, fake identities, and convincing phishing and spear phishing emails has made it challenging to spot potential frauds and distinguish between what is real and what isn't.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* A multinational company in Hong Kong loses US$25.6 million after employees are tricked by a deepfake video business meeting.
* A financial institution is tricked into transferring funds to fraudulent accounts using a convincing deepfake video.
* A criminal uses generative AI to create realistic videos, fake identities, and convincing deepfakes to commit fraud.
* A phishing or spear phishing email is sent to an employee, tricking them into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds to a fraudulent account.
* A company's internal compliance processes are compromised due to the use of generative AI to create convincing fake documents or emails.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The use of generative AI has made it easier for fraudsters to create realistic and convincing fake content, making it challenging to spot potential frauds.
* The increasing use of deepfakes and fake identities has made it difficult to distinguish between what is real and what isn't.
* The reliance on technology alone is not enough to prevent fraud, and a holistic approach is needed to address fraud.
* Employees need to be trained to spot, stop, and report AI-assisted fraud.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement robust internal compliance processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
* Use technology and AI platforms and solutions to help spot fraud and improve internal compliance processes.
* Train employees to spot, stop, and report AI-assisted fraud.
* Conduct regular training and courses to keep members up-to-date with new developments in AI-assisted fraud.
* Use a holistic approach to address fraud, including basic due diligence, using databases, and complex algorithms to identify suspicious transactions.

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The use of generative AI has significantly increased the risk of fraud across various industries. Fraudsters are using AI to create realistic and convincing fake content, making it challenging to spot potential frauds. It is essential to implement robust internal compliance processes and use technology and AI platforms and solutions to help spot fraud and improve internal compliance processes. Additionally, employees need to be trained to spot, stop, and report AI-assisted fraud. A holistic approach is needed to address fraud, including basic due diligence, using databases, and complex algorithms to identify suspicious transactions.

**CONCLUSION**

The growing use of generative AI has led to a significant increase in fraudulent activities across various industries. It is essential to implement robust internal compliance processes, use technology and AI platforms and solutions, and train employees to spot, stop, and report AI-assisted fraud. A holistic approach is needed to address fraud, including basic due diligence, using databases, and complex algorithms to identify suspicious transactions.
