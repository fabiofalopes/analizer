# SUMMARY
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warns that artificial intelligence (AI) will make scam emails look genuine, increasing the volume of online attacks and making it difficult to identify phishing messages.

# IDEAS:
* AI will make it difficult to spot whether emails are genuine or sent by scammers and malicious actors.
* Generative AI and large language models will complicate efforts to identify different types of attack such as spoof messages and social engineering.
* AI will increase the volume of cyber-attacks and heighten their impact over the next two years.
* Ransomware attacks are expected to increase, with AI making it easier for amateur cybercriminals to access systems and gather information on targets.
* AI will also work as a defensive tool, detecting attacks and designing more secure systems.
* The UK government has set out new guidelines encouraging businesses to better equip themselves to recover from ransomware attacks.
* Cybersecurity experts are calling for stronger action, including reassessing the approach to ransomware and creating stronger rules around the payment of ransoms.

# QUOTES:
* "To 2025, generative AI and large language models will make it difficult for everyone, regardless of their level of cybersecurity understanding, to assess whether an email or password reset request is genuine, or to identify phishing, spoofing or social engineering attempts."
* "Highly capable state actors are almost certainly best placed among cyber threat actors to harness the potential of AI in advanced cyber operations."
* "Unless public and private bodies fundamentally change how they approach the threat of ransomware, an incident of the severity of the British Library attack is likely in each of the next five years."

# FACTS:
* The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is part of the GCHQ spy agency.
* Generative AI has become widely available to the public through chatbots such as ChatGPT and free-to-use versions known as open source models.
* Ransomware attacks hit institutions such as the British Library and Royal Mail over the past year.
* The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, reported 706 ransomware incidents in the UK in 2022, compared with 694 in 2021.
