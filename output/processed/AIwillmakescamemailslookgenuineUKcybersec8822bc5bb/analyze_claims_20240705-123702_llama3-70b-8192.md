**ARGUMENT SUMMARY:** The UK's National Cyber Security Centre warns that artificial intelligence will make it difficult to spot scam emails and increase the volume of online attacks.

**TRUTH CLAIMS:**

**CLAIM:** AI will make it difficult to spot scam emails.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:**

* The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) report states that generative AI and large language models will complicate efforts to identify phishing, spoofing, and social engineering attempts. (Source: NCSC report)
* AI tools can create convincing text, voice, and images, making it harder to distinguish between genuine and scam emails. (Source: The Guardian)

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** None provided.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** B (High)

**LABELS:** Warnings, Cybersecurity, AI, Phishing, Scam Emails

**CLAIM:** The overall volume of online attacks is likely to increase.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:**

* The NCSC report states that AI will "almost certainly" increase the volume of cyber-attacks and heighten their impact over the next two years. (Source: NCSC report)
* Ransomware attacks, which have already hit institutions such as the British Library and Royal Mail, are expected to increase. (Source: The Guardian)

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** None provided.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** B (High)

**LABELS:** Warnings, Cybersecurity, AI, Ransomware, Online Attacks

**CLAIM:** Generative AI tools will help amateur cybercriminals and hackers access systems and gather information on targets.

**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:**

* The NCSC report states that the sophistication of AI "lowers the barrier" for amateur cybercriminals and hackers to access systems and gather information on targets. (Source: NCSC report)
* Generative AI tools can create fake "lure documents" that are more convincing and lack errors, making it easier for hackers to target victims. (Source: The Guardian)

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:** None provided.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:** None identified.

**CLAIM RATING:** B (High)

**LABELS:** Warnings, Cybersecurity, AI, Hackers, Cybercriminals

**OVERALL SCORE:**

LOWEST CLAIM SCORE: B (High)
HIGHEST CLAIM SCORE: B (High)
AVERAGE CLAIM SCORE: B (High)

**OVERALL ANALYSIS:** The article presents a well-supported and balanced view of the potential risks and consequences of AI in the context of cybersecurity. The claims are backed by evidence from reputable sources, including the NCSC report and expert opinions. The article highlights the need for increased awareness and action to address the growing threat of AI-powered cyber-attacks. Recommendation: Take the warnings seriously and stay informed about the latest developments in AI and cybersecurity to stay ahead of potential threats.
