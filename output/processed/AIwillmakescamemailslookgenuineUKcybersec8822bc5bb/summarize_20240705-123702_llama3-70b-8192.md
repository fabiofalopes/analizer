# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre warns that artificial intelligence will make scam emails appear genuine, increasing the volume and impact of cyber-attacks.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. AI will make it difficult to identify phishing emails and password reset requests.
2. Generative AI and large language models will complicate efforts to identify cyber-attacks.
3. Ransomware attacks are expected to increase, with AI making it easier for amateur cybercriminals to access systems.
4. AI will help create convincing "lure documents" for phishing attacks.
5. State actors may use AI to create new malware capable of avoiding security measures.
6. AI can also be used as a defensive tool to detect attacks and design more secure systems.
7. The UK government has set out new guidelines to encourage businesses to better equip themselves to recover from ransomware attacks.
8. Cybersecurity experts are calling for stronger action to address the threat of ransomware.
9. The NCSC warns that AI will increase the volume and impact of cyber-attacks over the next two years.
10. The UK needs to reassess its approach to ransomware, including creating stronger rules around ransom payments.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. AI is making it increasingly difficult to identify genuine emails and password reset requests.
2. Ransomware attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent.
3. AI can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes in cybersecurity.
4. Stronger action is needed to address the growing threat of ransomware.
5. The UK government and businesses need to work together to improve cybersecurity measures.
