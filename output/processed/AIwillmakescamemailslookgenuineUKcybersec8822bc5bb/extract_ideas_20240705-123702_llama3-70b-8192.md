* Artificial intelligence will make scam emails appear genuine, making it difficult to identify phishing messages.
* Generative AI tools will increase the volume of cyber-attacks and heighten their impact over the next two years.
* AI will complicate efforts to identify different types of attacks, such as spoof messages and social engineering.
* Large language models will make it difficult for people to assess whether an email or password reset request is genuine.
* Ransomware attacks are expected to increase, with AI tools helping amateur cybercriminals access systems and gather information.
* AI lowers the barrier for amateur cybercriminals and hackers to access systems and gather information on targets.
* Generative AI tools create fake "lure documents" that do not contain errors, making phishing attacks more convincing.
* AI will help sift through and identify targets for ransomware attacks.
* State actors can use AI to create new malware capable of avoiding security measures.
* AI can be used as a defensive tool to detect attacks and design more secure systems.
* Cybersecurity experts call for stronger action to combat ransomware attacks, including reassessing approaches to ransomware.
* Public and private bodies need to fundamentally change how they approach the threat of ransomware to prevent severe incidents.
* The UK needs to reassess its approach to ransomware, including creating stronger rules around ransom payments and giving up on "striking back" against criminals.
* AI will increase the sophistication of phishing attacks, making it harder to identify genuine emails.
* Cyber-attacks will become more convincing and difficult to detect with the use of AI tools.
* The overall volume of online attacks is likely to increase with the use of AI.
