# SUMMARY
The National Cyber Security Centre warns that artificial intelligence (AI) will make scam emails look genuine, increasing the volume of online attacks and making it difficult to identify phishing messages.

# IDEAS:
* AI will make scam emails look genuine and difficult to identify
* Generative AI tools will increase the volume of cyber-attacks
* AI will heighten the impact of cyber-attacks over the next two years
* AI will complicate efforts to identify phishing, spoofing, and social engineering attempts
* Ransomware attacks will increase, targeting institutions and demanding cryptocurrency ransoms
* AI will lower the barrier for amateur cybercriminals to access systems and gather information
* AI will help create convincing "lure documents" for phishing attacks
* AI will sift through and identify targets for ransomware attacks
* State actors will harness AI for advanced cyber operations
* AI will also work as a defensive tool, detecting attacks and designing secure systems
* The UK government sets out new guidelines for businesses to recover from ransomware attacks
* Cybersecurity experts call for stronger action against ransomware attacks

# INSIGHTS:
* AI will revolutionize the cyber threat landscape, making it harder to distinguish genuine from scam emails
* The increasing sophistication of AI tools will lead to more convincing phishing attacks
* Ransomware attacks will become more frequent and targeted, with AI playing a key role
* The UK government and businesses must reassess their approach to ransomware and cybersecurity
* AI has the potential to be a double-edged sword, both enhancing and defending against cyber-attacks

# QUOTES:
* "To 2025, generative AI and large language models will make it difficult for everyone, regardless of their level of cybersecurity understanding, to assess whether an email or password reset request is genuine, or to identify phishing, spoofing or social engineering attempts."
* "Highly capable state actors are almost certainly best placed among cyber threat actors to harness the potential of AI in advanced cyber operations."
* "Unless public and private bodies fundamentally change how they approach the threat of ransomware, an incident of the severity of the British Library attack is likely in each of the next five years."

# HABITS:
* None mentioned in the article.

# FACTS:
* The National Cyber Security Centre is part of the GCHQ spy agency
* Generative AI tools are widely available to the public through chatbots and open-source models
* Ransomware attacks hit institutions such as the British Library and Royal Mail in 2023
* The UK's data watchdog reported 706 ransomware incidents in 2022, compared to 694 in 2021
* The UK government sets out new guidelines for businesses to recover from ransomware attacks

# ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY
AI will revolutionize the cyber threat landscape, making it harder to distinguish genuine from scam emails and increasing the volume of online attacks.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Businesses should reassess their approach to ransomware and cybersecurity
* The UK government should create stronger rules around the payment of ransoms
* Public and private bodies should fundamentally change how they approach the threat of ransomware
* Cybersecurity experts should focus on developing defensive AI tools to detect attacks and design secure systems
