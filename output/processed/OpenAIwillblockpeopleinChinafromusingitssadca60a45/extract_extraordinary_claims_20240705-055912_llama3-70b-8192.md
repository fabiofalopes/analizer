After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on OpenAI's decision to block access to its services in China.

However, I did find some statements that could be considered misleading or lacking context:

* "OpenAI plans to block people from using ChatGPT in China, a country where its services aren’t officially available..." - This statement implies that OpenAI's services are not available in China, but the article later mentions that users and developers in China have been accessing ChatGPT via the company's API anyway.

* "The move could impact several Chinese startups which have built applications using OpenAI’s large language models." - This statement is vague and lacks specific examples or details about the impact on these startups.

* "It’s not clear what prompted OpenAI’s move." - This statement is unclear and lacks context, as the article mentions that OpenAI stopped covert influence operations, including one that originated from China, which could be a possible reason for the move.

* "Washington's pressure on American tech companies to limit China’s access to cutting-edge technologies developed in the US." - This statement is vague and lacks specific details about the nature of this pressure and how it relates to OpenAI's decision.

Overall, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria, but I did identify some statements that could be considered misleading or lacking context.
