# SUMMARY
Microsoft reports on Octo Tempest, a dangerous financial hacking group with advanced social engineering capabilities, targeting companies in data extortion and ransomware attacks.

# IDEAS:
* Octo Tempest is a native English-speaking threat actor with advanced social engineering capabilities.
* The group targets companies in data extortion and ransomware attacks.
* Octo Tempest's attacks have evolved since early 2022, expanding to new sectors and partnering with the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group.
* The group uses phishing, social engineering, and password resets to gain initial access.
* Octo Tempest deploys ransomware to steal and encrypt victim data.
* The group uses direct physical threats to obtain logins and advance their attack.
* Octo Tempest became an affiliate of the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation.
* The group targets organizations in various sectors, including gaming, natural resources, hospitality, and financial services.
* Octo Tempest uses advanced social engineering to trick technical administrators into performing password resets and MFA method resets.
* The group uses tools like Jercretz and TruffleHog to automate the search for plaintext keys, secrets, and passwords across code repositories.
* Octo Tempest tries to hide their presence on the network by suppressing alerts and modifying mailbox rules.
* The group uses open-source tools like ScreenConnect, FleetDeck, and AnyDesk in their attacks.
* Octo Tempest deploys Azure virtual machines to enable remote access via RMM installation or modification to existing resources via Azure serial console.
* The group adds MFA methods to existing users and uses tunneling tools like Twingate.
* Octo Tempest moves stolen data to their servers using Azure Data Factory and automated pipelines.
* The group registers legitimate Microsoft 365 backup solutions to export SharePoint document libraries and transfer files quickly.

# INSIGHTS:
* Octo Tempest's evolution to ransomware attacks marks a significant shift in their tactics.
* The group's use of direct physical threats to obtain logins is a concerning development.
* Octo Tempest's partnership with the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group highlights the growing threat of ransomware-as-a-service operations.
* The group's advanced social engineering capabilities make them a formidable threat to organizations.
* Octo Tempest's use of open-source tools and living-off-the-land techniques makes detection and hunting challenging.
* The group's financial motivation drives their attacks, which can result in significant financial losses for victims.

# QUOTES:
* "This is notable in that, historically, Eastern European ransomware groups refused to do business with native English-speaking criminals." - Microsoft
* "Initial bulk-export of users, groups, and device information is closely followed by enumerating data and resources readily available to the userâ€™s profile within virtual desktop infrastructure or enterprise-hosted resources." - Microsoft
* "Using compromised accounts, the threat actor leverages EDR and device management technologies to allow malicious tooling, deploy RMM software, remove or impair security products, data theft of sensitive files (e.g. files with credentials, signal messaging databases, etc.), and deploy malicious payloads." - Microsoft

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Monitor and review identity-related processes, Azure environments, and endpoints to detect malicious activity.
* Implement advanced social engineering training for technical administrators to prevent password resets and MFA method resets.
* Use open-source tools like Jercretz and TruffleHog to automate the search for plaintext keys, secrets, and passwords across code repositories.
* Implement tunneling tools like Twingate to enable remote access via RMM installation or modification to existing resources via Azure serial console.
* Register legitimate Microsoft 365 backup solutions to export SharePoint document libraries and transfer files quickly.
* Use Azure Data Factory and automated pipelines to move stolen data to servers.
* Implement advanced threat detection and response strategies to counter Octo Tempest's attacks.
