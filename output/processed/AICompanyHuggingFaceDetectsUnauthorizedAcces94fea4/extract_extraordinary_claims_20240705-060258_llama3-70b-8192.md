After analyzing the conversation, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts.

The conversation appears to be a factual report on a security incident at Hugging Face, an AI company, and does not contain any statements that indicate conspiracy theories, misinformation, or a lack of belief in commonly accepted scientific truth.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to output as there are no extraordinary claims made in the conversation.
