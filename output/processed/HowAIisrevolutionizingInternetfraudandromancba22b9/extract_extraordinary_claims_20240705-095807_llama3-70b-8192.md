After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on romance scams, the use of artificial intelligence in these scams, and the efforts of law enforcement to combat them.

However, I did find some quotes and statements that may be of interest:

* "It wasn't the money. It's the shame," - The McKinney woman who was scammed
* "You think, 'How could I be so stupid?' I tried to kill myself because I felt like I couldn't live knowing that I had participated in something like that." - The McKinney woman who was scammed
* "People do it a lot here (in Nigeria). So without learning about it, you already know everything about it because it's a common thing." - Chris Maxwell, former romance scammer
* "She became sick. She became depressed. She was going through hell because of me," - Chris Maxwell, former romance scammer
* "I felt really bad, really guilty. She was 61 years old. I have a mother and just imagined someone was doing this to my own mom." - Chris Maxwell, former romance scammer
* "It's a substantial problem and one that is rapidly accelerating," - Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun Rao with the U.S. Department of Justice
* "It's chilling and it makes it hard for law enforcement to intervene." - Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun Rao with the U.S. Department of Justice

These quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather statements from individuals involved in the story, including victims and perpetrators of romance scams, as well as law enforcement officials.
