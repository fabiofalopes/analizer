ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The article explores using uncensored language models in PrivateGPT, swapping out the default mistral LLM for an uncensored one, and testing alignment with various models.

MAIN POINTS:

1. Uncensored LLMs are free from guard rails and have "no morals" beyond their training data.
2. Public LLMs are aligned to be morally good and prevent harmful content, but who decides what is good and what should be disallowed?
3. The article uses the wizard-vicuna-uncensored model as an example, but the process works for any model in ollama's library.
4. To use a different model, find a model in the ollama library, start/serve ollama, pull the image, and modify the configuration YAML.
5. The article tests alignment with various models, including ChatGPT, Bing AI, Google Gemini, Claude 3, and PrivateGPT with Mistral and Uncensored WizardLM.
6. The uncensored WizardLM model fulfills requests without complaining, but results generated by AI are the user's responsibility.
7. The article concludes that users should be aware of the potential risks and responsibilities when using uncensored models.
8. The next article will explore uploading and querying information from documents.
9. The ollama library provides a range of models for specific purposes, including image processing and code writing.
10. The article highlights the importance of considering the moral implications of AI development and use.

TAKEAWAYS:

1. Uncensored language models can be used in PrivateGPT, but users must be aware of the potential risks and responsibilities.
2. The line between moral good and harm is blurry, and AI development should consider these implications.
3. Users should be cautious when using uncensored models and ensure they are used for morally just purposes.
4. The ollama library provides a range of models for specific purposes, including image processing and code writing.
5. AI development should prioritize transparency and accountability in model development and use.
