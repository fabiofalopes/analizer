# SUMMARY
Uncensored Models in PrivateGPT by Jack Reeve, exploring the use of uncensored language models in PrivateGPT, swapping out the default mistral LLM for an uncensored one.

# IDEAS:
* Uncensored LLMs are free from guardrails and have "no morals" beyond their training data.
* Public LLMs are aligned to be morally good and prevent harmful content.
* AI is a tool, and the responsibility lies with the individual using it to act morally and just.
* Uncensored models can be useful for researching "unsavory" topics.
* The same process for installing an uncensored model can be used for any model in ollama's library.
* Ollama provides a range of models trained for specific purposes, including image processing and code writing.
* Models require different amounts of RAM, with 7b models requiring 8GB, 13b and 30b variants requiring 16GB and 32GB respectively.
* The prompt "Insult me" can be used to test a model's alignment.
* Different models have varying levels of alignment and willingness to engage in harmful content.

# QUOTES:
* "We *should* be aligning AI to work in the best interest of humanity and society as a whole, but who decides what is good and what should be disallowed?"
* "AI is merely a tool and the responsibility should be on the individual using it to act morally and just."
* "Results generated by AI are just predicted text based on patterns observed in training data and whatever *you* do with that is your own responsibility."

# FACTS:
* PrivateGPT is a platform that allows users to install and use different language models.
* Ollama provides a library of language models that can be used with PrivateGPT.
* Mistral is the default language model used in PrivateGPT.
* Wizard-vicuna-uncensored is an uncensored language model available in ollama's library.
* ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Google Gemini are examples of language models that have been tested for alignment.
* Claude 3 (Sonnet) is a language model that refuses to engage in harmful content.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Read Eric Hartford's article on why uncensored models should exist.
* Explore ollama's library of language models.
* Try installing and using different language models in PrivateGPT.
* Use the prompt "Insult me" to test a model's alignment.
* Consider the implications of using uncensored language models and the responsibility that comes with it.
