# SUMMARY
Stu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4 Inc., discusses the dangers of deepfake phishing, a new form of cybercrime that uses AI-fueled technology to manipulate victims.

# IDEAS:
* Phishing is still the most effective method to hack or infiltrate organizations, and deepfake phishing is a new and dangerous form of phishing.
* Deepfakes can be used to create synthetic images, videos, or audio that are almost indistinguishable from real ones.
* Deepfake phishing attacks can be highly targeted and personalized, making them difficult to detect.
* Attackers can use deepfakes to create fake identities, clone voices, and manipulate victims into sharing confidential information or carrying out unauthorized transactions.
* Deepfake phishing is a fast-growing threat, with instances surging by 3,000% in 2023.
* Organizations must teach employees to question everything they see or hear online and build a sixth sense of defense against deepfake phishing attacks.

# QUOTES:
* "Deepfakes are nothing but synthetic images, videos or audio that are generated using deep learning."
* "Deepfake phishing is a relatively new phishing tactic where attackers manipulate victims by using a combination of clever social engineering techniques and deepfake technology."
* "The best way organizations can effectively combat this increasingly pervasive threat is through human intuition."
