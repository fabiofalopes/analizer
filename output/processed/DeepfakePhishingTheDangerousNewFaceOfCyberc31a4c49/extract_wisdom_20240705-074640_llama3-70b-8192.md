# SUMMARY
Stu Sjouwerman, founder and CEO of KnowBe4 Inc., discusses the dangers of deepfake phishing, a new form of cybercrime that uses AI-generated synthetic images, videos, or audio to manipulate victims.

# IDEAS
* Phishing is still the most effective method to hack or infiltrate organizations.
* Deepfake phishing is a new phishing tactic that uses AI-generated synthetic content to manipulate victims.
* Attackers can use deepfakes to create personalized messages, video calls, and voice messages to exploit trust and bypass security measures.
* Deepfake phishing attacks are highly targeted and difficult to detect.
* Generative AI tools are making deepfake technology increasingly sophisticated and accessible.
* Deepfake phishing attacks have surged by 3,000% in 2023.
* Organizations must teach employees to question everything they see or hear online.
* Human intuition is key to detecting and preventing deepfake phishing attacks.
* Phishing simulation programs can help train employees to recognize and report deepfakes.
* Robust authentication methods can reduce the risk of identity fraud.
* Zero-trust can help reduce the risk of lateral movement.
* Deepfake phishing attacks exploit human trust and gullibility.
* Regular social engineering awareness exercises can help build a sixth sense of defense.

# INSIGHTS
* Deepfake phishing is a highly effective form of cybercrime that exploits human trust and gullibility.
* The success of deepfake phishing lies in its ability to create highly personalized attacks.
* Human intuition is crucial in detecting and preventing deepfake phishing attacks.
* Organizations must prioritize employee awareness and training to combat deepfake phishing.
* The proliferation of generative AI tools is making deepfake technology increasingly accessible and sophisticated.

# QUOTES
* "Deepfakes are nothing but synthetic images, videos or audio that are generated using deep learning."
* "Phishing is still the most effective method to hack or infiltrate organizations."
* "Deepfake phishing is a relatively new phishing tactic that uses a combination of clever social engineering techniques and deepfake technology."
* "The best way organizations can effectively combat this increasingly pervasive threat is through human intuition."
