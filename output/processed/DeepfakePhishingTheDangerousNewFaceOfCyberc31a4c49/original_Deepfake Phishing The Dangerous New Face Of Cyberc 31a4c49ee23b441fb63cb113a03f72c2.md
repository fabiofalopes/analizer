Even though phishing has literally been around for decades, it’s still the most [effective](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/downloads/Cyber_Security_Report_2024_EN.pdf) method to hack or infiltrate organizations. This is because phishers are known to evolve their tactics in line with the evolution of technology.

In recent years, phishing has shapeshifted again, using a technology that some experts call the [most dangerous](https://techhq.com/2020/08/deepfakes-ranked-by-experts-as-most-serious-ai-crime-threat/) form of AI-fueled cybercrime in the world.

## What is deepfake phishing?

Deepfakes are nothing but synthetic images, videos or audio that are generated using [deep learning](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjwx4n_452DAxWe6jgGHeqiCkQQFnoECEAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geeksforgeeks.org%2Fintroduction-deep-learning%2F&usg=AOvVaw38XAHi4s378McXLQEp0XAA&opi=89978449), hence the name "deepfake." One might recognize deepfake technology from Photoshop or mobile applications that can alter images and backgrounds, make people younger or older, mimic or clone voices, inject people into movie scenes or morph faces on the bodies of celebrities.

Deepfake phishing is a relatively new phishing tactic where attackers manipulate victims by using a combination of clever social engineering techniques and deepfake technology.

## How does deepfake phishing work?

Deepfake phishing follows the same core principle that social engineering attacks follow, which is to confuse or manipulate users, exploit their trust and bypass traditional security measures. Attackers can weaponize deepfakes for phishing attacks in several different ways. These include:

### 1. Emails Or Messages

Businesses are already losing [billions of dollars](https://securityboulevard.com/2023/12/concerned-about-business-email-compromise-4-technologies-that-can-help/) to business email compromise (BEC) attacks (or CEO fraud) every year. Deepfakes make BEC attacks even more dangerous because threat actors can use this approach to personalize messages and make their identities seem more credible. For instance, attackers can create fake [LinkedIn profiles](https://analyticsdrift.com/stanford-researchers-discover-1000-ai-generated-deepfake-profiles-on-linkedin/) of CEOs and use them to lure employees.

### 2. Video Calls

An attacker can use a video deepfake over a [Zoom call](https://fortune.com/2022/09/03/live-deepfakes-detect-methods-zoom-fraud/) to engage and convince victims to share confidential information (such as credentials) or manipulate them into carrying out unauthorized financial transactions. For example, a scammer in [China](https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepfake-scam-china-fans-worries-over-ai-driven-fraud-2023-05-22/) used face-swapping technology to impersonate someone and convinced the victim to transfer $622,000.

### 3. Voice Messages

It’s extremely easy to clone anyone’s voice these days. All that’s required is a [three-second clip](https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsofts-ai-program-can-clone-your-voice-from-a-3-second-audio-clip). These deepfakes can be used to leave voicemail messages or engage people in live conversations, further blurring the lines between reality and deception. It is believed that [37%](https://regulaforensics.com/news/one-third-of-global-businesses-already-hit-by-voice-and-video-deepfake-fraud/) of organizations experienced a deepfake voice fraud in 2022.

## Why should organizations be concerned about deepfake phishing?

### 1. It’s a fast-growing threat.

Deepfake technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated and accessible thanks to [generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-prevent-deepfakes-in-the-era-of-generative-AI) tools. Instances of deepfake phishing and fraud have surged by an astounding [3,000%](https://thenextweb.com/news/deepfake-fraud-rise-amid-cheap-generative-ai-boom) in 2023.

### 2. It’s highly targeted.

Attackers can use deepfakes to create highly personalized attacks, targeting people based on their specific interests, hobbies and network of friends, exploiting vulnerabilities that are unique to select individuals and organizations.

### 3. It’s difficult to detect.

AI can mimic someone’s writing style, clone voices with [near-perfect](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2385752-ai-voices-are-hard-to-spot-even-if-you-know-audio-might-be-a-deepfake/) accuracy and create AI-generated faces that are indistinguishable from human faces. This makes deepfake phishing attacks extremely hard to detect.

## How can organizations mitigate the risk of deepfake phishing?

Deepfake phishing attacks are just getting started. Below are some best practices organizations can adopt to mitigate the risk of deepfake phishing:

### 1. Improve staff awareness of synthetic content.

Employees must be made aware of the increasing proliferation and distribution of synthetic content. Employees must be taught not to trust an online persona, individual or identity simply because they have some videos, photos or audio clips on their online profile.

### 2. Train employees to recognize and report deepfakes.

When it comes to phishing prevention and detection, nothing is more powerful than human intuition. Training employees to recognize and report fake online identities, visual anomalies such as lip sync inconsistencies, jerky head and torso movements, unusual audio cues, and irregular or suspicious requests is paramount. Organizations that do not have this training expertise can also consider phishing simulation programs that use real, in-the-wild example social engineering scripts.

### 3. Deploy robust authentication methods to reduce the risk of identity fraud.

Deploying tools such as phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication and zero-trust can certainly reduce the risk of identity theft and lateral movement to a degree. That said, security leaders can expect to see attackers attempting to hack or bypass authentication systems using clever deepfake-based social engineering techniques.

## Conclusion

At its core, the success and effectiveness of deepfake phishing lies in its ability to exploit human trust and gullibility. Organizations must teach employees to question everything they see or hear online and, through regular social engineering awareness exercises, build a sixth sense of defense—a muscle memory that kicks into gear the moment they spot something out of the ordinary. The best way organizations can effectively combat this increasingly pervasive threat is through human intuition.
