Here are the INSIGHTS:

• Large language models are being exploited for malicious purposes, such as creating false images and generating scam websites.
• OpenAI models are frequently used as the backend for malicious services, highlighting the need for AI safety measures.
• Malicious actors are using uncensored language models with minimal safety checks to generate harmful content.
• Jailbreaking techniques are being used to bypass safety features of public language models, particularly OpenAI's GPT Turbo 3.5.
• The availability of uncensored language models and lack of safety protocols enable malicious actors to misuse AI.
• Defaulting to models with robust censorship settings and restricting access to uncensored models can help mitigate AI misuse.
• LLM hosting platforms must establish clear guidelines and enforcement mechanisms to prevent misuse of language models.
• The proliferation of malicious language models underscores the need for practical solutions to make LLMs safer for public use.
• The study highlights the importance of understanding the real-world exploitation of LLMs to counteract cybercrime.
• The threat landscape of malicious actors using LLMs requires a comprehensive approach to building safer models and mitigating AI misuse.
