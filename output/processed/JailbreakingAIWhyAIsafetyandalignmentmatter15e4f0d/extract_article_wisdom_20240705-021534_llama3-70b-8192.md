**SUMMARY**
The article "Jailbreaking AI. Why AI safety and alignment matters?" by Martins discusses the importance of AI safety and alignment, highlighting the risks of jailbreaking AI models and the need for human-aligned values in AI development.

**IDEAS:**
* Jailbreaking AI models can disrupt human-aligned values and ethics, leading to malicious behavior.
* AI safety and alignment are crucial for the advancement of next-generation AI.
* Hackers play a vital role in identifying vulnerabilities and improving AI security.
* The cat-and-mouse game between hackers and AI developers is an endless process.
* Alignment is not enough; AI models need to be designed to strictly prevent certain behaviors.
* The development of AI models with human-aligned values is a complex and ongoing challenge.

**QUOTES:**
* "The main goal of jailbreaking is to disrupt the human-aligned values of LLMs or other constraints imposed by the model developer, compelling them to respond to malicious questions."
* "We need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us."
* "Importantly, we prove that within the limits of this framework, for any behavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with probability that increases with the length of the prompt."

**FACTS:**
* Jailbreaking AI models is not allowed by the terms of service for most legitimate AI services, including ChatGPT.
* AI models are vulnerable to various types of attacks, including jailbreaking, SQL injections, and DDOS.
* The use of jailbreaking prompts with ChatGPT can result in account termination for ToS violations.
* OpenAI is prioritizing alignment goals, recognizing the importance of AI safety and alignment.
