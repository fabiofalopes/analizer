**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement robust cybersecurity measures to prevent AI-powered cyberattacks, such as encryption and firewalls.
* Ensure that AI systems are designed and programmed with transparency and control in mind, allowing users to adjust privacy settings and delete data.
* Implement data breach notification procedures to ensure that users are informed in the event of a data breach.
* Use AI-powered applications that prioritize user privacy and security, such as those that use end-to-end encryption and have transparent data handling practices.
* Educate users on how to protect their personal data and how to use AI-powered applications securely.

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The threat of AI stealing personal data is a real concern, given the increasing use of AI in various industries. However, it's important to note that AI itself doesn't steal data, but rather relies on data to learn and make predictions. The responsibility lies with the companies using AI to handle data ethically, securely, and transparently. By implementing robust cybersecurity measures and prioritizing user privacy and security, we can minimize the risk of AI-powered cyberattacks and data breaches.

**CONCLUSION**

In conclusion, while AI has the potential to enhance our online experiences, it's important to prioritize user privacy and security. By implementing recommended controls and educating users on how to protect their personal data, we can minimize the risk of AI-powered cyberattacks and data breaches.
