# SUMMARY
This article, "How Google Is Solving Deep Fakes and Impersonation" by Arnold Wafula, discusses the role of AI responsibility in the growing AI space, highlighting the potential drawbacks of AI, such as social surveillance, deep fakes, job losses, unfair bias, voice phishing, impersonation, misinformation, and environmental impact.

# IDEAS
* AI is evolving rapidly, with developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) continuing to grow.
* AI has the potential to make groundbreaking changes in our lives, but it can also be detrimental.
* Social surveillance using AI's facial recognition technology is a growing concern.
* Deep fakes can spread misinformation and disinformation.
* AI can lead to job losses and unfair bias.
* Voice phishing and impersonation are potential criminal uses of AI.
* Misinformation and disinformation can have serious consequences.
* Environmental impact of AI is a growing concern.
* Google and AI labs are working on solutions to safeguard users and prevent misinformation.

# QUOTES
* "We should adapt so we don’t get replaced."
* "AI is part of our daily lives, so we must embrace it and adapt so we don’t get replaced."

# FACTS
* AI was an abstract concept a few years ago, but it has become a reality with the boom of generative AI apps.
* China uses AI's facial recognition technology to track citizens' movements.
* AI predicts crime hotspots based on arrest rates, which can lead to bias towards areas of minority communities.
* Facial recognition technology can't differentiate black people, leading to racial profiling.
* Deep fake technology uses deep learning to make images and videos of fake events.
* AI can learn a person's voice and use it for voice phishing and impersonation.
* AI-generated images and videos can spread misinformation and disinformation.
* Large Language Models' resource-intensive datasets produce high emissions.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
* Be skeptical of audio or video whose sources cannot be verified.
* Use tools to evaluate information and verify the authenticity of audio and video.
* Add metadata to images to show they are AI-generated.
* Use watermarking to show AI-generated images.
* Use guard rails to prevent misuse of AI technology.
* Provide authorized access to partners who wish to use AI technology.
* Use automated adversarial testing to detect toxicity in AI models.
