This article is not about a cybersecurity breach, but rather about the role of AI responsibility in the growing AI space, specifically how Google is working to solve deep fakes and impersonation. Therefore, it does not fit the format of the cybersecurity hack article analysis.

However, I can provide a summary of the article:

The article discusses the growing concern of AI-generated deep fakes and impersonation, and how Google is working to address these issues. It highlights the potential risks of AI, including social surveillance, job losses, unfair bias, voice phishing, impersonation, misinformation, and environmental impact. The article then outlines Google's principles for responsible AI development, including being socially beneficial, avoiding unfair bias, being built and tested for safety, being accountable to people, incorporating privacy design principles, upholding high standards of scientific excellence, and being made available for uses that accord with these principles. Finally, the article discusses the steps Google is taking to ensure responsible AI, including developing tools to evaluate information, providing authorized access to partners, and using automated adversarial testing to detect toxicity in their models.
