# PATTERNS

* Social engineering is a pervasive threat in the cyber industry, with 74% of data breaches involving the human element.
* Generative AI technology can be used to create highly convincing, targeted, and automated phishing messages at scale.
* AI can be used to design messages that are grammatically perfect, mimic someone's writing style, and generate mock videos.
* Deepfakes can be used to deceive and dupe targets, making it difficult to detect phishing attacks.
* AI can quickly assimilate and analyze large data sets to build target personas for social engineering attacks.
* Organizations need to develop security intuition in employees to detect and prevent social engineering attacks.
* Clear policies and processes are necessary to remind and reinforce employees of the need to stay vigilant when online.
* Advanced cybersecurity tools, such as phishing-resistant MFA and zero trust security, can help block social engineering attacks.
* AI-based cybersecurity controls can analyze large data sets to detect social engineering attempts.
* Password managers can reduce the risk of password reuse.
* OSINT can be used to identify potential exposures and mitigate social engineering attacks.
