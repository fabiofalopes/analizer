* Social engineering is the most pervasive threat in the cyber industry, with 74% of data breaches involving the human element.
* Cybercriminals have amassed $50 billion from business email compromise scams, a tiny fraction of social engineering fraud.
* Generative AI technology can create highly convincing, targeted, and automated phishing messages at scale, making social engineering attacks more dangerous.
* AI can design messages that are grammatically perfect, mimic someone's writing style, spoof a voice, or generate a mock video.
* Deepfakes can be used to deceive and dupe targets, making it difficult to detect social engineering attacks.
* AI can quickly assimilate and analyze large data sets to build target personas based on specific demographics, occupations, interests, income range, and activity.
* Social engineers can launch hyper-personalized social engineering and misinformation campaigns at scale using AI.
* Developing security intuition in employees is crucial to managing social engineering risks.
* Organizations must update policies and processes to reflect AI risks and specify dos and don'ts for employees.
* Advanced cybersecurity tools such as phishing-resistant MFA, zero trust security, and AI-based controls can help block social engineering attacks.
* Employee training, communications, and phishing simulation tests can help detect anomalies and recognize social engineering scams.
* Organizations must leverage advanced cybersecurity tools and adopt a multi-layered defense approach to mitigate AI social engineering risks.
* AI social engineering attacks are evolving, and employers must stay prepared to mitigate the impact and recover from attacks quickly.
