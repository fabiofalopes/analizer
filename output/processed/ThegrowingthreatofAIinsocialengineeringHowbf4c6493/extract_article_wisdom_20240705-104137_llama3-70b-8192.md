**SUMMARY**
The article discusses the growing threat of AI in social engineering, how it can be used to create highly convincing and targeted phishing attacks, and how businesses can mitigate these risks by developing security intuition in employees, updating policies and processes, and leveraging advanced cybersecurity tools.

**IDEAS**
* Social engineering is the most pervasive threat in the cyber industry, with 74% of data breaches involving the human element.
* Generative AI technology can be used to create highly convincing and targeted phishing attacks at scale.
* AI can be used to create deepfakes, which are synthetic audio, video, and images designed for deception.
* AI can be used to conduct reconnaissance and build target lists for social engineering attacks.
* Organizations can mitigate AI social engineering risks by developing security intuition in employees, updating policies and processes, and leveraging advanced cybersecurity tools.
* Phishing-resistant MFA, zero trust security, and email authentication protocols can help block social engineering attacks.
* AI-based cybersecurity controls can detect social engineering attempts based on contextual information.
* Password managers can reduce the risk of password reuse.
* OSINT can be used to identify potential exposures.

**QUOTES**
* "Social engineering is by far the cyber industry’s most pervasive threat."
* "Cybercriminals amassed about $50 billion from business email compromise (BEC) scams alone—a tiny fraction of social engineering fraud."
* "As soon as ChatGPT was launched, researchers reported more than a 1000% jump in phishing emails."
* "AI social engineering is just getting started."

**FACTS**
* 74% of data breaches involved the human element.
* Cybercriminals amassed about $50 billion from business email compromise (BEC) scams alone.
* There was a 1000% jump in phishing emails after the launch of ChatGPT.
* A finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into transferring $25 million to fraudsters using deepfakes.
* Similar incidents of deepfake scams are happening worldwide.
