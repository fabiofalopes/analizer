# SUMMARY
Stu Sjouwerman, Founder and CEO of KnowBe4 Inc., discusses the growing threat of AI in social engineering and how businesses can mitigate risks.

# IDEAS
* Social engineering is the most pervasive threat in the cyber industry, with 74% of data breaches involving the human element.
* Generative AI technology can be used to create highly convincing, targeted, and automated phishing messages at scale.
* AI can be used to design messages that are grammatically perfect, mimic someone's writing style, or generate a mock video.
* Deepfakes can be used to deceive and dupe targets, making it difficult to detect phishing attacks.
* AI can quickly assimilate and analyze large data sets to build target personas for social engineering attacks.
* Organizations can develop security intuition in employees through regular training and communications.
* Policies and processes should be updated to reflect AI risks and specify dos and don'ts for employees.
* Advanced cybersecurity tools such as phishing-resistant MFA, zero trust security, and AI-based controls can help block social engineering attacks.
* Password managers can reduce the risk of password reuse.
* OSINT can be used to identify potential exposures and detect social engineering attempts.

# INSIGHTS
* AI is supercharging social engineering attacks, making them more dangerous and deceptive.
* Social engineering attacks are difficult to detect, and AI makes them even harder to detect.
* Strengthening security instincts in employees is key to managing social engineering risks.
* Clear documentation, policies, and processes are essential to remind employees of the need to stay vigilant online.
* Advanced cybersecurity tools can help block social engineering attacks, but they are not foolproof.
* AI social engineering is a growing threat that requires a multi-layered approach to mitigate risks.

# QUOTES
* "Social engineering is by far the cyber industry's most pervasive threat."
* "AI is supercharging social engineering attacks, making them more dangerous and deceptive."
* "Strengthening security instincts in employees is key to managing social engineering risks."

# HABITS
* Regular training and communications to develop security intuition in employees.
* Updating policies and processes to reflect AI risks.
* Using advanced cybersecurity tools such as phishing-resistant MFA and zero trust security.
* Issuing password managers to employees to reduce password reuse.
* Conducting OSINT to identify potential exposures.

# FACTS
* 74% of data breaches involved the human element in the last year.
* Cybercriminals amassed about $50 billion from business email compromise (BEC) scams alone.
* There was a 1000% jump in phishing emails after ChatGPT was launched.
* A finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into transferring $25 million to fraudsters using deepfakes.
