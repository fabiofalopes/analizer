Here are the INSIGHTS:

• AI-powered social engineering attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted, making them harder to detect.
• Generative AI technology can create highly convincing phishing messages that mimic human writing styles and voices.
• Deepfakes can be used to deceive targets, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake communications.
• AI can quickly analyze large data sets to build target lists and launch hyper-personalized social engineering attacks.
• Developing security intuition in employees is crucial to mitigating AI social engineering risks.
• Organizations must update policies and processes to reflect AI risks and leverage advanced cybersecurity tools to block attacks.
• AI-based cybersecurity controls can detect social engineering attempts based on contextual information.
• Password managers can reduce the risk of password reuse, and OSINT can identify potential exposures.
• Multi-layered cybersecurity defenses are essential to detect and block AI social engineering threats.
• Employees must be trained to exercise their security intuition and recognize AI-powered social engineering attacks.
