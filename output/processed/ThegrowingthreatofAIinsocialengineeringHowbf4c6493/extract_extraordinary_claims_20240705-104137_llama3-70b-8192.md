After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a well-researched and informative piece on the growing threat of AI in social engineering and how businesses can mitigate risks.

However, I did not find any quotes that meet the criteria for extraordinary claims. The article presents a factual discussion on the topic, citing various sources and statistics to support its points. The author, Stu Sjouwerman, is the Founder and CEO of KnowBe4 Inc., a company that specializes in security awareness training and simulated phishing platforms, which adds credibility to the article.

If you would like me to extract any specific information or quotes from the article, I'd be happy to assist you.
