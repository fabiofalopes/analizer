Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Phishing attacks using generative AI to create highly convincing and targeted messages
* Deepfakes used to deceive and dupe targets
* Reconnaissance and building target lists using AI to identify vulnerabilities
* Misinformation campaigns using AI to spread false information

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The use of generative AI in social engineering attacks is a growing threat, with a 1000% increase in phishing emails reported since the launch of ChatGPT
* Deepfakes can be used to create synthetic audio, video, and images that are designed for deception, making it difficult to detect
* AI can quickly assimilate and analyze large data sets to build target personas and launch hyper-personalized social engineering campaigns
* Misinformation campaigns using AI can spread false information and manipulate public opinion

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Develop security intuition in employees through regular training and communications
* Update policies and processes to reflect AI risks and remind employees to stay vigilant online
* Leverage advanced cybersecurity tools such as phishing-resistant MFA, zero trust security, and email authentication protocols
* Use AI-based cybersecurity controls to analyze large data sets and detect social engineering attempts
* Run OSINT on the organization and its people to identify potential exposures

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The growing threat of AI in social engineering is a significant concern for businesses and individuals alike. The use of generative AI to create highly convincing and targeted phishing messages, deepfakes to deceive and dupe targets, and AI-powered reconnaissance to build target lists are all potential threats that can be used to manipulate and deceive. It is essential for organizations to develop security intuition in their employees, update policies and processes to reflect AI risks, and leverage advanced cybersecurity tools to mitigate these threats.

**CONCLUSION**

The use of AI in social engineering attacks is a growing threat that requires immediate attention and action. By developing security intuition in employees, updating policies and processes, and leveraging advanced cybersecurity tools, organizations can reduce the risk of AI-powered social engineering attacks and protect themselves from these threats.
