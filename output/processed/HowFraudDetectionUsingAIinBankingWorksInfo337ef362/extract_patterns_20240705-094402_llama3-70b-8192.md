# PATTERNS

* AI-powered systems can process huge amounts of data faster and more accurately than legacy software.
* Online fraud statistics are alarming, with cybercrime costing the world economy $600 billion annually.
* More than half of all financial institutions have stepped up to employ AI to detect and prevent fraud in 2022.
* AI can detect and flag anomalies in real-time banking transactions, app usage, payment methods, and other financial activities.
* Machine learning algorithms can self-learn by processing historical data and continuously attune themselves to evolving fraud patterns.
* AI-driven fraud detection and prevention models work by gathering, processing, and categorising historical data.
* AI can detect unusual activity such as password changes and contact details to prevent identity theft.
* ML algorithms can detect fraudulent activity through email subject lines, content, and other details and classify questionable emails as spam.
* AI can detect anomalies in the card owner’s spending patterns and flag them in real time to prevent credit card theft.
* AI-driven banking systems can build ‘purchase profiles’ of customers and flag transactions that depart significantly from the norm.
* ML algorithms can differentiate between original and fake identities, authenticate signatures, and spot forgeries with a high accuracy rate.
