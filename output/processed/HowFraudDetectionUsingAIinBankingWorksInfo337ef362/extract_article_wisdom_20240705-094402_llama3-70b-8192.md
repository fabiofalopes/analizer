# SUMMARY
Infosys BPM discusses the importance of AI in banking fraud detection and prevention, highlighting its efficiency, accuracy, and real-time detection capabilities.

# IDEAS:
* AI-powered systems can process huge amounts of data faster and more accurately than legacy software.
* AI models use complex ML algorithms that self-learn by processing historical data and continuously attune themselves to evolving fraud patterns.
* AI-driven fraud detection and prevention models can detect anomalies in real-time banking transactions, app usage, payment methods, and other financial activities.
* AI can build predictive models to mitigate fraud risk with minimal human intervention.
* AI in banking systems also minimises false positives, safeguarding the customer experience without compromising on security.
* AI can detect and flag anomalies in real-time, accelerating fraud detection and prevention.
* AI-driven banking systems can build 'purchase profiles' of customers and flag transactions that depart significantly from the norm.
* AI can differentiate between original and fake identities, authenticate signatures, and spot forgeries with a high accuracy rate.

# QUOTES:
* "Cybercrime costs the world economy $600 billion annually, which is 0.8% of the global GDP."
* "Studies show that in the first quarter of 2021 alone, fraud attempts rose 149% over the previous year â€“ fuelled, no doubt, by the post-Covid increase in online transactions."

# FACTS:
* Cybercrime costs the world economy $600 billion annually, which is 0.8% of the global GDP.
* Fraud attempts rose 149% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year.
* More than half of all financial institutions have stepped up to employ AI to detect and prevent fraud in 2022.
