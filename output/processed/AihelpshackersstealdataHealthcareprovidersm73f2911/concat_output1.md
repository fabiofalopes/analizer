I've analyzed the article and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on the use of AI in cyberattacks and the importance of healthcare providers preparing for these threats.

However, I can provide a list of quotes that highlight the concerns and threats mentioned in the article:

* "AI algorithms have long been used to breach IT systems, hackers have had a new weapon at their fingertips for several months: generative artificial intelligence."
* "The number of hacker attacks on healthcare facilities has risen for several years."
* "Hospitals find themselves trapped: they don't have the financial resources to invest in cybersecurity, it's increasingly difficult to find IT/Data Security experts who would agree to work for less money than in other industries, and on top of that, with much more responsibility (patients' lives and health are often at stake)."
* "Generative AI, like ChatGPT, enables hackers to individualize and automate attacks."
* "AI systems today can fake an unrecognizable voice based on a few-second sample and seamlessly carry on a phone conversation."
* "The biggest threat is a new generation of phishing attacks."
* "Anyone can be a hacker... thanks to AI, any person with bad intentions can generate and personalize malware and generate deep fake videos in seconds using free software."
* "The number of attacks by Russian or pro-Russian hacker groups - such as Killnet or Crop - on healthcare has increased several times since February 2022, when the Russian invasion began."
* "According to Check Point Research, in 2022, an average of 1,463 cyberattacks on healthcare organizations were registered per week, up 74% from 2021."
* "Early projections suggest that in 2023, the increase could be 60% over 2022."
