**SUMMARY**
This chapter discusses unaligned AI models, which lack safety measures and can be used for harmful purposes, such as generating phishing emails and spreading misinformation. The chapter covers models like FraudGPT, WormGPT, PoisonGPT, WizardLM Uncensored, and Falcon 180B, highlighting their features and potential risks.

**IDEAS**
* Unaligned AI models can be used for malicious purposes, such as generating phishing emails and spreading misinformation.
* These models lack safety measures, such as alignment criteria, which guide AI responses towards ethical and beneficial behavior.
* Uncensored models, like WizardLM Uncensored, can be used to generate content that is not restricted by alignment criteria.
* Maligned AI models, like FraudGPT and WormGPT, are designed to aid cyberattacks and malicious code generation.
* The debate over alignment criteria is ongoing, with some arguing that unaligned models offer a compelling alternative to biased censorship.
* The use of unaligned models can impede users' autonomy in AI interactions and hinder legitimate applications, such as creative writing and research.

**QUOTES**
* "These models are covered in more detail below."
* "FraudGPT has surfaced as a concerning AI-driven cybersecurity anomaly operating in the shadows of the dark web and platforms like Telegram."
* "PoisonGPT is a malicious AI model designed to spread targeted false information."
* "The creators manipulated using ROME to demonstrate danger of maliciously altered LLMs."
* "Disregarding uncensored models or dismissing the debate over them is probably not a good idea."

**FACTS**
* FraudGPT is a concerning AI-driven cybersecurity anomaly that operates in the shadows of the dark web and platforms like Telegram.
* WormGPT is based on the GPT-J-6B model and has a range of abilities, including handling extensive text, retaining conversational context, and formatting code.
* PoisonGPT is a malicious AI model designed to spread targeted false information.
* WizardLM Uncensored is an uncensored model that allows users to generate content that is not restricted by alignment criteria.
* Falcon 180B is an unaligned model that excels in SotA performance across natural language tasks.
