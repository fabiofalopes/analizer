Here are the extraordinary claims extracted from the conversation:

* FraudGPT is a concerning AI-driven cybersecurity anomaly operating in the shadows of the dark web and platforms like Telegram. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]
* FraudGPT is used for creating harmful content, including phishing emails and scam landing pages. [No concrete technical information is accessible to the public, and the prevailing knowledge surrounding FraudGPT is primarily based on speculative insights.]
* WormGPT is a malicious AI model that can generate compelling and tailored content, including phishing emails and code that holds the potential for harmful consequences. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]
* PoisonGPT is a malicious AI model designed to spread targeted false information, and it can be used to generate responses that are intentionally inaccurate. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]
* Uncensored models like WizardLM Uncensored can be used to generate content that was previously unattainable with other aligned models, including harmful or false content. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]
* Falcon 180B is an unaligned model that excels in SotA performance across natural language tasks, surpassing previous open-source models and rivalling LLaMA-2 and OpenAI's GPT-3.5. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]
* Falcon 180B has not undergone alignment tuning to restrict the generation of harmful or false content, making it a potential risk for generating fake news and content. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]
* Maligned AI models like FraudGPT, WormGPT, and PoisonGPT should probably be illegal to create or use. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]
* Uncensored models like WizardLM Uncensored and Falcon 180B offer a compelling alternative to aligned models, allowing users to build AI systems potentially free of biased censorship. [No credible evidence is provided to support this claim.]

Note that these claims are not supported by credible evidence and may be considered extraordinary or unsubstantiated.
