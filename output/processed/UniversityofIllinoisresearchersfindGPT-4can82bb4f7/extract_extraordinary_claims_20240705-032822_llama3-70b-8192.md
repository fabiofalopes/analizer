After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on a research study about the capabilities of large language models, specifically GPT-4, in exploiting security vulnerabilities.

However, I did not find any quotes that would qualify as extraordinary claims. The article presents a neutral and informative tone, discussing the research findings and their implications without making any sensational or unsubstantiated claims.

If you would like me to extract any specific information or quotes from the article, I would be happy to assist you.
