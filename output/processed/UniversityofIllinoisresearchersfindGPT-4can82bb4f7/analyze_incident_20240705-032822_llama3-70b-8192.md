**Summary:** Researchers at the University of Illinois found that GPT-4 can exploit real-life security flaws, including 15 one-day vulnerabilities in Mitre's list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

**Key Details:**

* **Attack Type:** Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities
* **Vulnerable Component:** Not specified (various non-commercial tools)
* **Attacker Information:**
	+ **Name/Organization:** Not applicable (research study, no attacker involved)
	+ **Country of Origin:** Not applicable
* **Target Information:**
	+ **Name:** Not applicable (research study, no specific target)
	+ **Country:** Not applicable
	+ **Size:** Not applicable
	+ **Industry:** Not applicable
* **Incident Details:**
	+ **CVE's:** 15 one-day vulnerabilities in Mitre's list of CVEs (not specified)
	+ **Accounts Compromised:** Not applicable
	+ **Business Impact:** Not applicable
	+ **Impact Explanation:** GPT-4 can write malicious scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities using publicly available data.
	+ **Root Cause:** Not applicable (research study, no specific incident)

**Analysis & Recommendations:**

* **MITRE ATT&CK Analysis:** Not applicable
* **Atomic Red Team Atomics:** Not applicable
* **Remediation:**
	+ **Recommendation:** Allow LLMs to digest and train on CVE data to help defenders synthesize threat alerts, or completely block them from accessing vulnerability lists.
	+ **Action Plan:** Not specified
* **Lessons Learned:** The study highlights the potential risks of advanced LLMs being able to autonomously exploit security vulnerabilities, and the need for AI model operators to find ways to reign in these malicious use cases.
