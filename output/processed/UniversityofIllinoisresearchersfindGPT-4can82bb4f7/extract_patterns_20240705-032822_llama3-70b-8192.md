# PATTERNS
* GPT-4 can write malicious scripts to exploit known security vulnerabilities using publicly available data.
* Large language models can create exploits in known security vulnerabilities.
* Government officials and cybersecurity executives warn of AI systems automating and speeding up malicious actors' attacks.
* GPT-4 has an 87% success rate in exploiting vulnerabilities based on CVE data.
* More advanced LLMs may be able to autonomously follow the same tasks as GPT-4.
* AI model operators struggle to reign in malicious use cases.
* Allowing LLMs to digest and train on CVE data can help defenders synthesize threat alerts.
* Operators have limited choices in blocking LLMs from accessing vulnerability lists.
* Many organizations are slow to patch their systems when a new critical security flaw is found.
* Researchers consistently find new malicious use cases for generative AI tools.
* The legal gray area surrounding AI research hinders progress.

# META
* The University of Illinois researchers tested 10 publicly available LLM agents to see if they could exploit 15 one-day vulnerabilities.
* The data used in the study contains real-world, high severity vulnerabilities.
* GPT-4 was the most advanced model in the group at the time of the study.
* The researchers used CVE data to test the models' capabilities.
* OpenAI asked the researchers to not disclose the specific prompts used to prevent bad actors from replicating the experiment.
* The study's findings indicate a trend in AI capabilities rather than a statement on current capabilities.

# ANALYSIS
GPT-4's ability to exploit known security vulnerabilities using publicly available data raises concerns about the potential for AI systems to automate and speed up malicious attacks, highlighting the need for AI model operators to address malicious use cases and for organizations to prioritize patching critical security flaws.
