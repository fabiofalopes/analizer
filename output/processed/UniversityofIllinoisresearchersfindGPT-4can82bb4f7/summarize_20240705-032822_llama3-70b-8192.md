# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
University of Illinois researchers find that GPT-4 can exploit real-life security flaws, raising concerns about AI-powered hacking.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. GPT-4 can write malicious scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities using publicly available data.
2. The model was tested on 15 one-day vulnerabilities and had an 87% success rate.
3. Researchers found that GPT-4 could follow nearly 50 steps to exploit a specific flaw.
4. More advanced LLMs have been released since the tests, which could also exploit vulnerabilities.
5. AI model operators struggle to prevent malicious use cases.
6. Allowing LLMs to train on CVE data can help defenders synthesize threat alerts.
7. Operators must choose between allowing models to train on vulnerability data or blocking access.
8. Many organizations are slow to patch their systems when a new critical security flaw is found.
9. Researchers are consistently finding new malicious use cases for generative AI tools.
10. The research falls into a legal gray area, potentially violating GPT-4's terms of service.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. GPT-4's ability to exploit security flaws raises concerns about AI-powered hacking.
2. The research highlights the need for AI model operators to address malicious use cases.
3. The legal gray area surrounding AI research must be addressed to enable further conversation.
4. The ability of LLMs to exploit vulnerabilities could lead to a new era of AI-powered attacks.
5. The research underscores the importance of patching systems quickly to prevent exploitation.
