# SUMMARY
University of Illinois researchers find GPT-4 can exploit real-life security flaws, with a success rate of 87% in exploiting 15 one-day vulnerabilities in Mitre's list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

# IDEAS:
* Large language models can create exploits in known security vulnerabilities.
* GPT-4 can write malicious scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities using publicly available data.
* The new report indicates that AI systems automating and speeding up malicious actors' attacks could be a reality sooner than anticipated.
* GPT-4 was the only model that could exploit the vulnerabilities based on CVE data.
* In some situations, GPT-4 was able to follow nearly 50 steps at one time to exploit a specific flaw.
* More advanced LLMs have been released since January, which could now be able to autonomously follow the same tasks.
* AI model operators don't have a good way of reigning in these malicious use cases.
* Allowing LLMs to digest and train on CVE data can help defenders synthesize the wave of threat alerts coming their way each day.
* Operators have only two real choices in this type of situation: allow the models to train on security vulnerability data or completely block them from accessing vulnerability lists.
* Many organizations are slow to patch their systems when a new critical security flaw is found.
* Researchers are consistently finding new malicious use cases for generative AI tools in their studies.
* The University of Illinois team's work went against GPT-4's terms of service and could get them banned from future use.
* Enabling this kind of research is going to be extremely important.

# INSIGHTS:
* AI systems are capable of automating and speeding up malicious actors' attacks.
* Large language models can exploit known security vulnerabilities with a high success rate.
* The ability of AI models to digest and train on CVE data can be a double-edged sword.
* The slow patching of systems by organizations can be exploited by malicious actors.
* The legal gray area surrounding AI research needs to be addressed.
* The importance of enabling research on AI's malicious use cases cannot be overstated.

# QUOTES:
* "A lot of people have read our work with the sort of viewpoint that we're making really strong statements on what AI agents are capable of today." - Daniel Kang
* "But what we're really trying to show is actually the trends and capabilities." - Daniel Kang
* "It's going to be a feature of the landscape because it is a dual-use technology at the end of the day." - Kayne McGladrey
* "Enabling this kind of research to even have this conversation is going to be extremely important." - Daniel Kang

# HABITS:
* The researchers tested 10 publicly available LLM agents to see if they could exploit 15 one-day vulnerabilities.
* The team conducted the bulk of its tests in January.
* The researchers used publicly available data to test the models.

# FACTS:
* GPT-4 has an 87% success rate in exploiting 15 one-day vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerabilities affect noncommercial tools.
* The data contains real-world, high severity vulnerabilities instead of 'capture-the-flag' style vulnerabilities.
* Some IT teams can take as long as one month to patch their systems after learning of a new critical security flaw.

# ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY
GPT-4 can exploit real-life security flaws with an 87% success rate, highlighting the need for AI model operators to address malicious use cases.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
* AI model operators should find ways to reign in malicious use cases.
* Researchers should continue to study AI's malicious use cases.
* Organizations should prioritize patching their systems quickly.
* The legal gray area surrounding AI research should be addressed.
* Enabling research on AI's malicious use cases is crucial.
