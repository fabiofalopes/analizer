Here are the INSIGHTS:

• Hackers exploit large language models using techniques like prompt injection, prompt leaking, and data training poisoning.
• Malicious users can hijack language model outputs for harmful purposes using cleverly crafted inputs.
• Jailbreaking generative AI chatbots involves bypassing safety features using prompt injection techniques.
• Model inversion attacks reconstruct sensitive information from language models by querying them with crafted inputs.
• Data extraction attacks focus on extracting specific sensitive information from language models.
• Model stealing attacks involve replicating language models by recording interactions and training new models.
• Membership inference attacks determine whether specific data points were part of a language model's training dataset.
• Large language models can be vulnerable to hacking due to their complexity and reliance on human interactions.
• Hackers continually develop novel approaches to exploit language models, requiring developers to update security measures.
• Social engineering techniques are often used in conjunction with hacking large language models.
• The global adoption of generative AI tools has led to the emergence of new hacking techniques.
