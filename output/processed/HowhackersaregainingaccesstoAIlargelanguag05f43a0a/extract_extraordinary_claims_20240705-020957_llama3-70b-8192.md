I've reviewed the article and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a legitimate discussion of hacking techniques related to large language models and does not contain any misinformation or conspiracy theories.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to output as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
