**SUMMARY**
This article discusses the transformative power of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in cybersecurity. It highlights the challenges of cybersecurity, including identity-based attacks, phishing, and the increasing number of connected devices. The article explores three use cases of LLMs and generative AI in cybersecurity: copilots that boost the efficiency and capabilities of security teams, generative AI that improves common vulnerability defense, and foundation models for cybersecurity.

**IDEAS**
* LLMs and generative AI can transform cybersecurity by improving threat detection, data generation, and vulnerability defense.
* Copilots with RAG can extend the capabilities of human analysts, making them more efficient and effective.
* Generative AI can improve vulnerability defense by synthesizing and contextualizing data.
* Foundation models for cybersecurity can address the data gap, perform "what if" scenarios, and feed downstream anomaly detectors.
* Synthetic data generation can provide 100% detection of spear phishing emails.

**QUOTES**
* "Cybersecurity is a data problem, and the vast amount of data available is too large for manual screening and threat detection."
* "With AI, organizations can achieve 100 percent visibility of their data and quickly discover anomalies, enabling them to detect threats faster."
* "By 2025, two-thirds of businesses will leverage a combination of generative AI and RAG to power domain-specific, self-service knowledge discovery, improving decision efficacy by 50%."

**FACTS**
* Identity-based attacks are on the rise, with phishing remaining the most common and second-most expensive attack vector.
* The number of connected devices continues to grow, introducing security risks due to an increase in the attack surface.
* Cybersecurity is among the top three challenges for CEOs, second to environmental sustainability and just ahead of tech modernization.
* Generative AI can help security analysts find the information they need to do their jobs faster, generate synthetic data to train AI models to identify risks accurately, and run what-if scenarios to better prepare for potential threats.
