# SUMMARY
Uncensored AI Models: The Importance of Composable Alignment in Cultural Diversity and Research Freedom by Andrea Belvedere, discussing the need for uncensored AI models and composable alignment to promote cultural diversity, research freedom, and responsible AI use.

# IDEAS
* AI models with built-in alignment can prevent dangerous or inappropriate responses, but may hinder cultural diversity and research freedom.
* Uncensored models can better respond to diverse cultural, political, and creative needs of global users.
* Composable alignment offers a balanced approach, allowing for flexible adaptation to different contexts and requirements.
* Users should have full control over AI models running on their devices, without restrictions imposed by third parties.
* Cultural diversity requires AI models that can reflect a wide range of values and norms.
* Alignment can limit the use of AI in creative or academic contexts, such as writing fiction or conducting pure research on controversial topics.
* Composable alignment promotes responsible and safe use of artificial intelligence while respecting freedom of expression.

# QUOTES
* "Uncensored or unaligned models seem to perform better compared to aligned models like GPT-4, PaLM, and others."
* "American culture is not the only one that exists. Different cultures might desire models that reflect their specific values."
* "Users should have full control over the models running on their devices, without restrictions imposed by third parties."

# FACTS
* AI models like ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of textual data to understand natural language and generate relevant responses.
* Many AI models, including Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM, and others, are designed with built-in alignment.
* Goodhart's law states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
* The reward model is an imperfect proxy, and optimizing its value too much can hinder ground truth performance.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
* Create uncensored AI models to promote cultural diversity and research freedom.
* Implement composable alignment to balance safety and freedom of expression.
* Allow users to have full control over AI models running on their devices.
* Foster collaboration within the open-source AI community to create responsible and safe AI models.
* Consider the need for uncensored models in creative or academic contexts.
