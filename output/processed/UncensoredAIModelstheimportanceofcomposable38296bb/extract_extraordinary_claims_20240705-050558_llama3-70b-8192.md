After analyzing the text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The text appears to be a well-researched and informative article discussing the importance of composable alignment in AI models, the need for uncensored models, and the balance between safety and freedom of expression.

The article presents a nuanced and balanced view of the topic, citing various sources and research papers to support its arguments. It does not contain any claims that are misleading, false, or promoting misinformation.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide as there are no extraordinary claims made in the text.
