# SUMMARY
Ingrid Stevens presents a guide to implementing a local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system over audio files using Whisper, Ollama, and FAISS.

# IDEAS
* Implementing a 100% local RAG system over audio files using Whisper, Ollama, and FAISS ensures privacy and independence.
* The Whisper API can be used for transcribing audio to text locally.
* LangChain can be used for tokenization, embeddings, and query-based generation.
* Ollama Embeddings can be used to create embeddings for each chunk of text.
* FAISS can be used to create a vector store for similarity searches.
* A local LLM model can be used for generating responses to queries.
* The entire process can be kept local, avoiding reliance on external servers.
* The approach is free and requires no API keys.
* The process involves transcribing audio to text, tokenizing and embedding the text, setting up a local LLM model and prompt, and generating a response using chain completion.
* The approach can be used for various applications, including question answering and text generation.
* Experimenting with different audio files, tokenizers, embedding models, prompts, and queries can improve results.
* The approach can be used for local insights in audio files.

# INSIGHTS
