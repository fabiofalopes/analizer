Here are the INSIGHTS:

• Local Retrieval Augmented Generation systems can be implemented without relying on external servers or API keys.
• Whisper API can be used for transcribing audio files to text locally and freely.
• LangChain and local language models enable tokenization, embeddings, and query-based generation locally.
• RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and Ollama Embeddings can be used for tokenizing and creating embeddings of transcribed text.
• FAISS vector store can be used for finding semantically similar documents to a query.
• Local LLM models like Ollama can be used for generating responses based on context and query.
• RAG systems can be implemented locally, ensuring privacy and independence from external servers.
• Experimenting with different audio files, tokenizers, embedding models, prompts, and queries can improve RAG system results.
• Local RAG systems can be used for uncovering insights and answering questions from audio files without relying on external servers.
