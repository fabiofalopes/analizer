**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
This tutorial guides users through a step-by-step process for implementing a 100% local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system over audio documents using Whisper, Ollama, and FAISS.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. The RAG system involves transcribing audio to text using the OpenAI Whisper API.
2. Local models are used for tokenization, embeddings, and query-based generation.
3. The process is free, requires no API keys, and is completely locally run.
4. The Whisper API is used to transcribe the audio file.
5. LangChain is used for tokenizing and creating embeddings.
6. Ollama Embeddings and FAISS are used for creating embeddings and vector stores.
7. A local LLM model (Ollama) is set up with a prompt for the RAG system.
8. A query is defined and similar documents are found in the vector store.
9. A response is generated based on the query and context of similar documents.
10. The entire process is kept local, ensuring privacy and independence.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

1. Implementing a local RAG system can be done using Whisper, Ollama, and FAISS.
2. Local models can be used for tokenization, embeddings, and query-based generation.
3. The process can be kept private and independent by avoiding external servers.
4. The RAG system can be used for various applications, such as question-answering and text generation.
5. Experimenting with different audio files, tokenizers, embedding models, prompts, and queries can improve results.
