SUMMARY
Chat with Your Audio Locally is a guide to implementing a 100% local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system over audio documents using Whisper, Ollama, and FAISS.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Whisper API for audio transcription
- LangChain for tokenization, embeddings, and query-based generation
- Ollama for local language models (LLMs)
- FAISS for vector store

TARGET AUDIENCE
- Developers and researchers interested in natural language processing and audio analysis
- Individuals seeking to implement local RAG systems for audio files

OUTCOMES
- Transcribe audio files to text using Whisper API
- Tokenize and embed text using LangChain
- Set up local LLM model and prompt for RAG system
- Generate responses based on query and context of similar documents

SOCIETAL IMPACT
- Enables local and private audio analysis and generation, reducing reliance on external servers and promoting data privacy
- Facilitates development of local RAG systems for various applications, such as audio-based question answering and content generation
- May have implications for accessibility, education, and entertainment industries

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Severity: LOW
- Concerns around potential misuse of local RAG systems for malicious purposes, such as generating misleading or harmful content

SUSTAINABILITY
- Environmental: LOW (local processing reduces carbon footprint)
- Economic: MEDIUM (dependent on cost of local computing resources and model maintenance)
- Social: HIGH (promotes data privacy, accessibility, and local innovation)

SUMMARY and RATING
- This project promotes local and private audio analysis and generation, with potential benefits for accessibility, education, and entertainment industries.
- Societal benefit: HIGH
- Sustainability: MEDIUM
