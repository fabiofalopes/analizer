# IDEAS
* Implementing a 100% local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system over audio documents ensures privacy and independence.
* Transcribing audio to text using the OpenAI Whisper API enables local language models (LLMs) for tokenization, embeddings, and query-based generation.
* Keeping the entire process local avoids reliance on external servers and is completely free, requiring no API keys.
* Tokenizing and creating embeddings allow for splitting transcription into smaller chunks and finding similarities between them.
* LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and Ollama Embeddings enable tokenization and embedding of text.
* FAISS vector store enables efficient similarity searches for query-based generation.
* Local LLM models like Ollama enable query-based generation and response generation.
* Defining a prompt and setting up a local LLM model enables a RAG system to answer questions about the contents of a transcribed audio file.
* Using a chat prompt template ensures concise and referenced answers to questions.
* Loading a QA chain enables question answering based on the context of similar documents.
* Defining a query and finding similar documents enables semantic search and response generation.
* Generating a response based on the query and context of similar documents enables a complete RAG system.
* Experimenting with different audio files, tokenizers, embedding models, prompts, and queries can improve RAG system results.
* Implementing a local RAG system ensures complete control over data and processing.
