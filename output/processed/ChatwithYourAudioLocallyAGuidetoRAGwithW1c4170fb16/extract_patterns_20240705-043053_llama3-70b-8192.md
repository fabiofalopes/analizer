# PATTERNS
* Local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be implemented using Whisper API, LangChain, and local LLMs for audio file transcription and query-based generation.
* Keeping the entire process local ensures privacy and independence from external servers.
* Tokenization and embeddings are necessary steps in the RAG process to split the transcription into smaller chunks and find similarities between them.
* Local LLM models like Ollama can be used for query-based generation and prompt setup.
* FAISS vector stores can be used for similarity searches and document retrieval.
* RAG systems can be improved by experimenting with different audio files, tokenizers, embedding models, prompts, and queries.

# META
* The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to implementing a local RAG system using Whisper API, LangChain, and local LLMs.
* The process involves transcribing audio files, tokenizing and embedding the text, setting up a local LLM model and prompt, and generating a response using chain completion.
* The Whisper API is used for audio file transcription, and LangChain is used for tokenization, embeddings, and query-based generation.
* Ollama is used as the local LLM model, and FAISS is used for the vector store.
* The tutorial provides links to the README and Notebook on GitHub for further reference.
