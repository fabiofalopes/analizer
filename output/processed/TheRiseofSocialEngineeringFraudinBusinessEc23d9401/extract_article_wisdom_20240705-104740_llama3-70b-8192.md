# SUMMARY
The Rise of Social Engineering Fraud in Business Email Compromise by Microsoft Security discusses the increasing threat of social engineering in business email compromise (BEC) attacks, highlighting four prominent threat groups and providing guidance on how to protect against social engineering fraud.

# IDEAS:
* Social engineering is present in 90% of phishing attacks today.
* BEC attacks emphasize social engineering and the art of deception.
* Social engineers manipulate human levers to achieve a desired outcome.
* Threat groups often target company executives, senior leadership, finance managers, and human resources staff.
* New employees are more susceptible to verifying unfamiliar email requests.
* Organizations need to stay up to date on the latest threat intelligence and adversarial activity.
* Four prominent threat groups that leverage social engineering and BEC are Octo Tempest, Diamond Sleet, Sangria Tempest, and Midnight Blizzard.
* Social engineering fraud can be protected against by keeping personal and work accounts separate, enforcing MFA, educating users on the danger of oversharing personal information online, and securing company computers and devices with endpoint security software, firewalls, and email filters.

# QUOTES:
* "Social engineering is generally a long con."
* "Once this trust has been established, social engineers can manipulate victims into taking certain actions that would otherwise be out of character."
