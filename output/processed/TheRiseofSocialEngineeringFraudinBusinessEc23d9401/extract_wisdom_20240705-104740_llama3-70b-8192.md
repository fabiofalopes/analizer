# SUMMARY
Microsoft Security discusses the rise of social engineering fraud in business email compromise (BEC) attacks, highlighting the importance of multifactor authentication, employee education, and threat intelligence to defend against these attacks.

# IDEAS:
* Social engineering is present in 90% of phishing attacks today.
* Business email compromise (BEC) attacks emphasize social engineering and deception.
* Social engineers manipulate human levers to achieve a desired outcome.
* Four prominent threat groups leveraging social engineering and BEC are Octo Tempest, Diamond Sleet, Sangria Tempest, and Midnight Blizzard.
* Social engineering fraud can take months of planning and research to build trust with victims.
* Employees should keep personal and work accounts separate to prevent threat actors from impersonating programs.
* Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not a perfect solution, as attackers use SIM swapping to compromise phone numbers used for MFA.
* Organizations should educate users on the danger of oversharing personal information online.
* Secure company computers and devices with endpoint security software, firewalls, and email filters.
* Social engineers constantly look for new ways to make their attacks more effective.
* Monitoring ongoing threat intelligence and ensuring defenses are up to date can prevent social engineers from using successful attack vectors.

# INSIGHTS:
* Social engineering is a critical component of BEC attacks, making it essential to understand and defend against these tactics.
* Threat actors target company executives, senior leadership, finance managers, and human resources staff to gain access to sensitive information.
* New employees are more susceptible to verifying unfamiliar email requests, making them a prime target for social engineers.
* Organizations must stay up to date on the latest threat intelligence and adversarial activity to defend against BEC attacks.
* A combination of multifactor authentication, employee education, and threat intelligence is necessary to protect against social engineering fraud.

# QUOTES:
* "Social engineering is present in 90% of phishing attacks today."
* "Social engineers manipulate human levers to achieve a desired outcome."
* "Social engineering fraud can take months of planning and research to build trust with victims."

# HABITS:
* Keep personal and work accounts separate to prevent threat actors from impersonating programs.
* Enforce the use of multifactor authentication (MFA) to protect against social engineering fraud.
* Educate users on the danger of oversharing personal information online.
* Secure company computers and devices with endpoint security software, firewalls, and email filters.
* Monitor ongoing threat intelligence and ensure defenses are up to date to prevent social engineers from using successful attack vectors.

# FACTS:
* 90% of phishing attacks today involve social engineering.
* Four prominent threat groups leveraging social engineering and BEC are Octo Tempest, Diamond Sleet, Sangria Tempest, and Midnight Blizzard.
* Social engineers target company executives, senior leadership, finance managers, and human resources staff to gain access to sensitive information.
* New employees are more susceptible to verifying unfamiliar email requests, making them a prime target for social engineers.
