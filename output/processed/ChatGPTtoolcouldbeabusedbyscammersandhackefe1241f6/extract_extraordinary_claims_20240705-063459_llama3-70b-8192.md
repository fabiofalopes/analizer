After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on the potential misuse of AI tools, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT feature, for cyber-crime and scams.

However, I did not find any quotes that indicate the person is a conspiracy theorist, engaging in misinformation, or denying commonly accepted scientific truths. The article presents a neutral and informative tone, discussing the potential risks and concerns associated with the use of AI tools for malicious purposes.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide in the output.
