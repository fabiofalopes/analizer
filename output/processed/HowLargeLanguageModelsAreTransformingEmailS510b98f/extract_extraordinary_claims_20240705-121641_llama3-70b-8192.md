After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The text appears to be a legitimate discussion about the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in email security, specifically in detecting phishing and spear-phishing attacks.

The text does not contain any quotes that indicate conspiracy theories, misinformation, or a denial of commonly accepted scientific truths. The discussion is focused on the application of AI technologies in email security and does not venture into areas that are known to be false or disputed by the scientific community.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide in the output.
