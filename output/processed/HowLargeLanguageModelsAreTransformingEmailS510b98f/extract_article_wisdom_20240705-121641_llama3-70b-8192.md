# SUMMARY
How Large Language Models Are Transforming Email Security by Vade Secure, discussing the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in phishing detection and email security.

# IDEAS:
* Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape of email security by enabling rapid analysis of emails to identify potential scams.
* LLMs can be used to fine-tune, prompt, and respond to text generation problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
* NLP combines rule-based modeling of human language with machine learning and statistical models to process and generate speech and text.
* ChatGPT is a more advanced LLM that can be given prompts to respond to, making it better at solving tasks.
* Vade Secure uses LLMs and NLP to evaluate the likelihood of an email being a phishing scam by comparing patterns in the email text to known phishing patterns.
* LLMs can also be used to generate potential phishing messages, allowing Vade Secure to train their models on real-time phishing messages observed in the wild.
* The combination of LLMs, NLP, and other factors enables Vade Secure to provide a likelihood of a given email being a spear phishing attempt, broad phishing attack, graymail, or spam.
* AI-powered vigilance is necessary to stay ahead of hackers and cybercriminals who are using LLMs to craft generic messages at scale that appear legitimate.

# QUOTES:
* "Leveraging AI technologies has become a cornerstone of defense strategies, enabling rapid analysis of emails to identify potential scams with greater efficiency than ever before."
* "Arguments could be made to try and trace back the sender of an email, to better detect domain spoofing, or otherwise expend more resources examining the data attached to a given email."
* "Phishing scammers are getting increasingly clever, and use a variety of tactics to slip into your inbox."
* "What we have found to be most effective is to combine technical signals of potential phishing, such as redirects and sends from risky domains, with NLP to evaluate the likelihood a given set of text may be a phishing scam."
* "When ChatGPT became widely available and started to be referenced in Scama packs, our analysts were already looking at ways to stay ahead of such tactics."
