Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Phishing attacks using ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft generic messages that appear legitimate
* Spear-phishing attacks using fake-forwarded emails and open redirects
* Phishing scams using risky words and phrases, such as "Dear sir or madam," "eBay gift cards," or "get rich quick"
* Graymail attacks using legitimate email addresses and display names
* Spam attacks using simple automated filtering and basic risk factors

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The use of LLMs and NLP in email security is crucial in detecting phishing attacks, as they can analyze and evaluate the likelihood of a given email being a phishing scam
* ChatGPT and other LLMs can be used to generate potential phishing messages, making it essential to combine technical signals of potential phishing with NLP to evaluate the likelihood of a given set of text being a phishing scam
* The algorithm used by Vade combines multiple elements of an email message, including what's contained in the body of the text, to evaluate the likelihood of a given email being a phishing scam
* The algorithm is updated in real-time with reports from flagged emails, helping to improve the accuracy of the models with the latest threats and data

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement a layered approach to email security, combining technical signals of potential phishing with NLP to evaluate the likelihood of a given set of text being a phishing scam
* Use LLMs and NLP to analyze and evaluate the likelihood of a given email being a phishing scam
* Update the algorithm in real-time with reports from flagged emails to improve the accuracy of the models with the latest threats and data
* Use a combination of technical signals, including redirects and sends from risky domains, with NLP to evaluate the likelihood of a given email being a phishing scam

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The use of LLMs and NLP in email security is a game-changer in detecting phishing attacks. By combining technical signals of potential phishing with NLP, we can evaluate the likelihood of a given set of text being a phishing scam. The algorithm used by Vade is a great example of this, as it combines multiple elements of an email message to evaluate the likelihood of a given email being a phishing scam. The use of LLMs and NLP also allows us to stay ahead of attackers who are using these platforms to craft generic messages that appear legitimate.

**CONCLUSION**

The use of LLMs and NLP in email security is a powerful tool in detecting phishing attacks. By combining technical signals of potential phishing with NLP, we can evaluate the likelihood of a given set of text being a phishing scam. The algorithm used by Vade is a great example of this, as it combines multiple elements of an email message to evaluate the likelihood of a given email being a phishing scam.
