# IDEAS
* Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming email security by improving phishing detection.
* LLMs can fine-tune, prompt, and respond to text generation problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
* NLP combines rule-based modeling of human language with machine learning and statistical models to process and generate speech and text.
* ChatGPT is a more advanced LLM that can be given prompts to respond to and is better at solving tasks with large amounts of training data.
* LLMs and NLP are necessary for phishing detection because they can analyze emails more efficiently than traditional methods.
* Phishing scammers use various tactics to slip into inboxes, making LLMs and NLP essential for detection.
* Combining technical signals of potential phishing with NLP evaluation of text likelihood is an effective approach to email security.
* LLMs can be used to generate potential phishing messages, helping to improve phishing detection algorithms.
* Real-time reporting and user feedback can improve the accuracy of phishing detection models.
* LLMs can help identify emails generated by generative AI, making them more effective at detecting phishing attempts.
* AI-powered vigilance is necessary to stay ahead of hackers and cybercriminals using LLMs to craft legitimate-looking phishing emails.
* LLMs can analyze emails more effectively than humans, who can be fooled or distracted.
* Factoring in multiple elements, such as email address and header data, can improve the accuracy of phishing detection.
* LLMs can help detect risky emails in new categories, such as W2 fraud, where targets may be particularly vulnerable.
* Combining LLMs with other security measures can provide comprehensive protections for businesses and clients.
