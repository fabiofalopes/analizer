# PATTERNS

* Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming email security by improving phishing detection.
* LLMs can be fine-tuned to respond to prompts and generate human-like text.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to analyze and understand human language.
* Combining NLP with machine learning and statistical models enables processing and generating speech and text.
* ChatGPT is a more advanced LLM that can be given prompts to respond to.
* LLMs can be used to detect phishing scams by analyzing patterns in email text.
* Phishing scammers are getting increasingly clever, using tactics like domain spoofing and open redirects.
* A layered approach to email security is necessary to combat phishing attacks.
* Technical signals of potential phishing, such as redirects and sends from risky domains, can be combined with NLP to evaluate the likelihood of an email being a phishing scam.
* LLMs can be used to generate potential phishing messages and train models to recognize them.
* Real-time reporting and updates are essential to improve the accuracy of phishing detection models.
* LLMs can be used to detect when an email is generated by generative AI.
* AI-powered vigilance is necessary to stay ahead of phishing attacks.
