I've reviewed the article and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a legitimate discussion of the risks and challenges posed by generative AI in the context of banking and fraud prevention.

There are no quotes that indicate the author is a conspiracy theorist, engaging in misinformation, or promoting false scientific claims. The article presents a factual discussion of the potential risks and consequences of generative AI in the financial industry, citing various sources and experts in the field.

Therefore, I have no quotes to provide as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
