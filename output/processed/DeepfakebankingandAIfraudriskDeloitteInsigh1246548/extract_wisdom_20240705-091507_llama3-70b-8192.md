# SUMMARY
Deloitte Insights presents a report on the rising risk of deepfake banking fraud enabled by generative AI, discussing the challenges and opportunities for financial institutions to prepare for this new era of fraud prevention.

# IDEAS
* Generative AI is making fraud easier and cheaper to commit, with a "self-learning" system that updates its ability to fool detection systems.
* Deepfake videos, voices, and documents are easily available to bad actors, making current anti-fraud tools less effective.
* Financial services firms are concerned about generative AI fraud accessing client accounts, with deepfake incidents increasing 700% in fintech in 2023.
* Business email compromises are particularly vulnerable to generative AI, with potential losses of $11.5 billion by 2027.
* Banks are using AI and machine learning to detect and respond to threats, but existing risk management frameworks may not be adequate.
* Collaboration between banks, third-party technology providers, and customers is crucial to stay ahead of generative AI fraud.
* Banks should invest in hiring and training talent to spot, stop, and report AI-assisted fraud.
* Generative AI is expected to raise the threat of fraud, potentially costing banks and customers $40 billion by 2027.

# INSIGHTS
* The democratization of nefarious software is making fraud more accessible and affordable.
* Financial institutions need to continually accelerate their self-learning to keep pace with fraudsters.
* Collaboration and knowledge-sharing within and outside the banking industry are essential to stay ahead of generative AI fraud.
* Banks must redesign their strategies, governance, and resources to future-proof against fraud.
* Customer education and awareness are critical in preventing fraud losses.

# QUOTES
* "Generative AI offers seemingly endless potential to magnify both the nature and the scope of fraud against financial institutions and their customers; it’s limited only by a criminal’s imagination."
* "The democratization of nefarious software is making a number of current anti-fraud tools less effective."
* "Banks should focus on their efforts to fight generative AI-enabled fraud to maintain a competitive edge."

# HABITS
* Banks should continually accelerate their self-learning to keep pace with fraudsters.
* Financial institutions should prioritize customer education and awareness in preventing fraud losses.
* Banks should invest in hiring and training talent to spot, stop, and report AI-assisted fraud.

# FACTS
* Deepfake incidents increased 700% in fintech in 2023.
* Business email compromises caused substantial monetary loss, with 21,832 instances in 2022 and losses of approximately $2.7 billion.
* Generative AI email fraud losses could total about $11.5 billion by 2027 in an "aggressive" adoption scenario.
* The FBI counted 26 categories of fraud, with business email compromises being one of the most common types.
