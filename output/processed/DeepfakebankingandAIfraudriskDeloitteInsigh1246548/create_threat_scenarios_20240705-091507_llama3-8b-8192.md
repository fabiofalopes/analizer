**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

Deepfake Banking and AI Fraud Risk

The rise of generative AI has made fraud a lot easier and cheaper to pull off, posing a significant threat to financial institutions and their customers. The ready availability of new generative AI tools can create deepfake videos, fictitious voices, and fictitious documents, making it challenging for banks to stay ahead of fraudsters.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Business email compromises: Fraudsters use social engineering to compromise individual and business email accounts, conducting unauthorized money transfers.
* Deepfake videos and audio: Fraudsters create convincing fake content to deceive financial institutions and customers.
* Fictitious documents: Fraudsters create fake documents to impersonate legitimate entities or individuals.
* Large-scale fraud: Fraudsters use generative AI to target multiple victims at the same time, making it difficult for banks to detect and prevent fraud.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

The threat of generative AI-enabled fraud is real and growing. Banks must focus on developing strategies to combat this threat, including coupling modern technology with human intuition to determine how technologies may be used to preempt attacks by fraudsters. Anti-fraud teams must continually accelerate their self-learning to keep pace with fraudsters.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement AI-powered fraud detection systems to identify fake content and transactions.
* Use machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction patterns and identify suspicious activity.
* Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
* Educate customers on the risks of generative AI-enabled fraud and provide guidance on how to protect themselves.
* Collaborate with other financial institutions and industry partners to share intelligence and best practices.
