# SUMMARY
AI has democratized spear phishing attacks, making them easily accessible to everyday individuals, by Appdome.

# IDEAS:
* Spear phishing attacks are no longer limited to high-profile targets, but can now be easily created and highly effective against millions of everyday individuals.
* Mobile malware provides attackers with the data needed to carry out social engineering attacks.
* AI technologies have significantly enhanced the believability of social engineering attacks.
* AI-generated smishing attacks are highly targeted, personalized, and convincing.
* AI-based voice cloning can create near-perfect replicas of anyone's voice, making vishing attacks more credible.
* AI-powered chatbots can engage in real-time conversations with victims, making scams more interactive and believable.
* Fighting social engineering at a technical level is more effective than relying on security awareness training.
* Brands and enterprises can detect and use data on malware and technical methods of control to break the cycle of manipulation and control over victims.

# QUOTES:
* "What if these same humans were armed with data about the malware and technical methods being used against them in the moment of the attack?"
* "What if, armed with this data and threat-aware, responsive workflows in mobile applications, they were given time to think, compare, and consider their actions before taking them?"
* "The human brain still outpaces it."

# FACTS:
* Mobile malware is ubiquitous and provides attackers with the data needed to carry out social engineering attacks.
* AI technologies have significantly enhanced the believability of social engineering attacks.
* AI-generated smishing attacks are highly targeted, personalized, and convincing.
* AI-based voice cloning can create near-perfect replicas of anyone's voice.
* AI-powered chatbots can engage in real-time conversations with victims.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Fight social engineering at a technical level by detecting the methods that attackers use to collect data and control the user.
* Use data from a layered mobile defense model to create, alter, or adjust the user experience to break the cycle of manipulation and control over victims.
* Implement threat-aware, responsive workflows in mobile applications to give users time to think, compare, and consider their actions before taking them.
* Arm users with data about the malware and technical methods being used against them in the moment of the attack.
