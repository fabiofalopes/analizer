Here are the INSIGHTS:

• AI has democratized spear phishing attacks, making everyday individuals vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.
• Mobile malware provides attackers with extensive data and control over victims, enabling highly effective social engineering attacks.
• AI-generated spear phishing attacks are highly believable, personalized, and convincing, making them challenging to distinguish from legitimate communications.
• AI-powered chatbots can engage in real-time conversations with victims, making scams more interactive and believable.
• Security awareness training may no longer be sufficient to combat AI-powered social engineering attacks.
• Fighting social engineering at a technical level is crucial to detect and prevent attacks, rather than relying solely on human vigilance.
• Brands and enterprises can transform humans into the strongest link in defeating social engineering attacks by arming them with data on malware and technical methods of control.
• The human brain still outpaces AI, and empowering humans with data and threat-aware workflows can help them outsmart attackers.
• The democratization of spear phishing attacks puts everyone at risk, regardless of professional or social status.
• Automation of social engineering attacks makes it essential for brands and enterprises to develop technical solutions to detect and prevent attacks.
• AI-generated attacks can be highly targeted, making it crucial to develop solutions that can adapt to evolving attack methods.
