# SUMMARY
Tom Tovar and Chris Roeckl discuss how AI has democratized spear phishing attacks, making them a threat to everyday individuals, and propose a technical solution to combat these attacks.

# IDEAS:
* AI has made spear phishing attacks more accessible and effective against everyday individuals.
* Mobile malware provides attackers with extensive data for social engineering attacks.
* AI-generated smishing attacks are highly targeted and convincing.
* AI-based voice cloning can impersonate anyone's voice, making vishing attacks more credible.
* AI-powered chatbots can engage in real-time conversations with victims, making scams more interactive.
* Security awareness training may not be enough to combat AI-powered social engineering attacks.
* Fighting social engineering at a technical level can be more effective.
* Detecting malware and technical methods of control can empower humans to break the cycle of manipulation.
* Humans, armed with data, can become the strongest link in cyber-defense.

# INSIGHTS:
* AI has democratized spear phishing attacks, making them a threat to everyone.
* Mobile malware is a key enabler of social engineering attacks.
* AI-generated attacks are highly believable and targeted.
* Technical solutions are needed to combat AI-powered social engineering attacks.
* Humans can be empowered to combat social engineering attacks with data and threat-aware workflows.

# QUOTES:
* "AI has democratized spear phishing attacks, making them a threat to everyday individuals."
* "Mobile malware is a terribly excellent source of data and control over victims in social engineering attacks."
* "The effectiveness of social engineering attacks has skyrocketed with AI."
* "Humans, armed with data, can become the strongest link in cyber-defense."

# HABITS:
* Continuous security training is essential for consumers and employees.
* Brands and enterprises should fight social engineering at a technical level.
* Using data on malware and technical methods of control can empower humans to break the cycle of manipulation.

# FACTS:
* Mobile malware is ubiquitous and provides extensive data for social engineering attacks.
* AI-generated smishing attacks are highly targeted and convincing.
* AI-based voice cloning can impersonate anyone's voice.
* AI-powered chatbots can engage in real-time conversations with victims.
