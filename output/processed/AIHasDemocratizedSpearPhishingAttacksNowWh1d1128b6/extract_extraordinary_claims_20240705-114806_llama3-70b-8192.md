After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a legitimate discussion on the topic of AI-powered spear phishing attacks and how they can be detected and prevented at a technical level.

However, I did find a few statements that could be considered debatable or open to interpretation:

* "AI makes the line between real and fake, legitimate and malicious, thinner and thinner by the day." - This statement could be seen as an exaggeration or an oversimplification of the complexity of AI-powered social engineering attacks.

* "It's doubtful that brands and enterprises can rely on security awareness training as a first line of defense for much longer." - This statement could be seen as a subjective opinion rather than a factual claim.

* "As powerful as AI has become, the human brain still outpaces it." - This statement could be seen as an oversimplification of the capabilities of AI and human intelligence.

* "Armed with this data and threat-aware, responsive workflows in mobile applications, they were given time to think, compare, and consider their actions before taking them?" - This statement could be seen as a hypothetical scenario rather than a factual claim.

Overall, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria specified. The article appears to be a legitimate discussion on the topic of AI-powered spear phishing attacks and how they can be detected and prevented at a technical level.
