After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on a research study about an AI worm that can infiltrate email systems and access data without user interaction.

The article does not contain any quotes that deny scientific truths, such as evolution, climate change, or the moon landing. The researchers' claims are based on their study and experiments, and they are warning about the potential risks of AI-powered email assistants.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to list as extraordinary claims. The article appears to be a legitimate report on a scientific study, and the researchers' claims are based on their research and expertise.
