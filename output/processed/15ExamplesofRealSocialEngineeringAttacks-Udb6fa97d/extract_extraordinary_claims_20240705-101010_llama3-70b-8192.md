I've reviewed the text and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by experts. The text appears to be a legitimate article discussing various social engineering attacks and scams, providing examples and warnings to readers.

However, I did notice that the article is promoting a product or service called Tessian, which is a cloud email security solution. While this is not an extraordinary claim, it's essential to be aware of the potential bias and commercial interest behind the article.

If you'd like, I can help you extract the quotes and examples of social engineering attacks mentioned in the article.
