Here are the extraordinary claims extracted from the article:

* **Forest Blizzard**: Using LLMs to understand satellite communication protocols, radar imaging technologies, and specific technical parameters. (Claim: LLMs can be used to understand complex technical information)
* **Emerald Sleet**: Interacting with LLMs to research into think tanks and experts on North Korea, as well as the generation of content likely to be used in spear-phishing campaigns. (Claim: LLMs can be used to generate content for social engineering)
* **Crimson Sandstorm**: Using LLMs to generate various phishing emails, including one pretending to come from an international development agency and another attempting to lure prominent feminists to an attacker-built website on feminism. (Claim: LLMs can be used to generate phishing emails)
* **Charcoal Typhoon**: Engaging LLMs to research and understand specific technologies, platforms, and vulnerabilities, indicative of preliminary information-gathering stages. (Claim: LLMs can be used to gather information on technologies and vulnerabilities)
* **Salmon Typhoon**: Using LLMs to identify and resolve coding errors, and to refine operational command execution. (Claim: LLMs can be used to assist in coding and operational command execution)
* **LLM-informed reconnaissance**: Employing LLMs to gather actionable intelligence on technologies and potential vulnerabilities. (Claim: LLMs can be used to gather intelligence on technologies and vulnerabilities)
* **LLM-enhanced scripting techniques**: Utilizing LLMs to generate or refine scripts that could be used in cyberattacks, or for basic scripting tasks such as programmatically identifying certain user events on a system and assistance with troubleshooting and understanding various web technologies. (Claim: LLMs can be used to generate or refine scripts for cyberattacks)
* **LLM-aided development**: Utilizing LLMs in the development lifecycle of tools and programs, including those with malicious intent, such as malware. (Claim: LLMs can be used in the development of malicious software)
* **LLM-supported social engineering**: Leveraging LLMs for assistance with translations and communication, likely to establish connections or manipulate targets. (Claim: LLMs can be used to support social engineering)
* **LLM-assisted vulnerability research**: Using LLMs to understand and identify potential vulnerabilities in software and systems, which could be targeted for exploitation. (Claim: LLMs can be used to identify vulnerabilities in software and systems)
* **LLM-optimized payload crafting**: Using LLMs to assist in creating and refining payloads for deployment in cyberattacks. (Claim: LLMs can be used to create and refine payloads for cyberattacks)
* **LLM-enhanced anomaly detection evasion**: Leveraging LLMs to develop methods that help malicious activities blend in with normal behavior or traffic to evade detection systems. (Claim: LLMs can be used to evade detection systems)
* **LLM-directed security feature bypass**: Using LLMs to find ways to circumvent security features, such as two-factor authentication, CAPTCHA, or other access controls. (Claim: LLMs can be used to bypass security features)
* **LLM-advised resource development**: Using LLMs in tool development, tool modifications, and strategic operational planning. (Claim: LLMs can be used in tool development and operational planning)

Note that these claims are extraordinary because they involve the use of LLMs in ways that are not yet widely accepted or understood, and may have potential security implications.
