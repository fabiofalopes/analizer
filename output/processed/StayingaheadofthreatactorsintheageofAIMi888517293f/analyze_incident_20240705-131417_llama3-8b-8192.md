* **Remediation:**
	+ **Recommendation:** Implement multifactor authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust defenses to prevent attackers from using AI-based tools to improve their existing cyberattacks.
	+ **Action Plan:** 1. Update software, 2. Train staff, and 3. Implement MFA and Zero Trust defenses.
* **Lessons Learned:** The article highlights the importance of staying ahead of threat actors in the age of AI and the need for defenders to prioritize the safe and responsible use of AI technologies.

**LLM-themed TTPs:**

* **LLM-informed reconnaissance:** Employing LLMs to gather actionable intelligence on technologies and potential vulnerabilities.
* **LLM-enhanced scripting techniques:** Utilizing LLMs to generate or refine scripts that could be used in cyberattacks, or for basic scripting tasks such as programmatically identifying certain user events on a system and assistance with troubleshooting and understanding various web technologies.
* **LLM-aided development**: Utilizing LLMs in the development lifecycle of tools and programs, including those with malicious intent, such as malware.
* **LLM-supported social engineering**: Leveraging LLMs for assistance with translations and communication, likely to establish connections or manipulate targets.
* **LLM-assisted vulnerability research**: Using LLMs to understand and identify potential vulnerabilities in software and systems, which could be targeted for exploitation.
* **LLM-optimized payload crafting**: Using LLMs to assist in creating and refining payloads for deployment in cyberattacks.
* **LLM-enhanced anomaly detection evasion**: Leveraging LLMs to develop methods that help malicious activities blend in with normal behavior or traffic to evade detection systems.
* **LLM-directed security feature bypass**: Using LLMs to find ways to circumvent security features, such as two-factor authentication, CAPTCHA, or other access controls.
* **LLM-advised resource development**: Using LLMs in tool development, tool modifications, and strategic operational planning.
