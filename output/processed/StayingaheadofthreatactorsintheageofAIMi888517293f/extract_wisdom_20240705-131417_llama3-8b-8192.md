# SUMMARY

Microsoft and OpenAI have published research on emerging threats in the age of AI, focusing on identified activity associated with known threat actors, including prompt-injections, attempted misuse of large language models (LLMs), and fraud. The research highlights the rapid development and adoption of AI, which has increased the speed, scale, and sophistication of attacks. Microsoft and OpenAI have taken measures to disrupt assets and accounts associated with threat actors, improve the protection of LLM technology and users from attack or abuse, and shape the guardrails and safety mechanisms around their models.

# IDEAS:

* The speed, scale, and sophistication of attacks have increased alongside the rapid development and adoption of AI.
* Threat actors are exploring and testing different AI technologies as they emerge, in an attempt to understand potential value to their operations and the security controls they may need to circumvent.
* AI technologies will continue to evolve and be studied by various threat actors.
* Microsoft will continue to track threat actors and malicious activity misusing LLMs, and work with OpenAI and other partners to share intelligence, improve protections for customers, and aid the broader security community.
* The use of LLMs by threat actors is not yet widespread, but it is a growing concern.
* Microsoft and OpenAI are working together to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI technologies like ChatGPT.
* The research highlights the importance of strong cybersecurity and safety measures, including multifactor authentication and Zero Trust defenses.
* The use of LLMs by threat actors is not limited to a specific type of attack, but rather is a tool that can be used in a variety of ways.
* The research emphasizes the need for a collaborative approach to addressing the misuse of AI, including sharing intelligence and best practices between organizations.
* The use of LLMs by threat actors is not a new phenomenon, but rather is a growing concern that requires continued attention and investment in cybersecurity.
* The research highlights the importance of understanding the motivations and goals of threat actors, as well as their tactics and techniques.
* The use of LLMs by threat actors is not limited to a specific geographic region, but rather is a global phenomenon.
* The research emphasizes the need for a proactive approach to addressing the misuse of AI, including developing and implementing effective countermeasures.
* The use of LLMs by threat actors is not a single event, but rather is a continuous process that requires ongoing monitoring and analysis.
* The research highlights the importance of understanding the role of AI in the cyberattack lifecycle, including the use of AI in reconnaissance, exploitation, and command and control.
* The use of LLMs by threat actors is not limited to a specific type of malware, but rather is a tool that can be used in a variety of ways.
* The research emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing the misuse of AI, including developing and implementing effective countermeasures.
* The use of LLMs by threat actors is not a new phenomenon, but rather is a growing concern that requires continued attention and investment in cybersecurity.
