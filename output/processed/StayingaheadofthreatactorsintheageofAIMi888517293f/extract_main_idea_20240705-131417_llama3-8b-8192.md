**MAIN IDEA**
Microsoft and OpenAI have published research on emerging threats in the age of AI, focusing on identified activity associated with known threat actors, including prompt-injections, attempted misuse of large language models (LLMs), and fraud.

**MAIN RECOMMENDATION**
Microsoft and OpenAI recommend taking measures to disrupt assets and accounts associated with threat actors, improving the protection of LLM technology and users from attack or abuse, and shaping the guardrails and safety mechanisms around their models.
