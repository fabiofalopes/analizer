# IDEAS:

* The speed, scale, and sophistication of attacks have increased alongside the rapid development and adoption of AI.
* Defenders are only beginning to recognize and apply the power of generative AI to shift the cybersecurity balance in their favor and keep ahead of adversaries.
* Microsoft and OpenAI have published research on emerging threats in the age of AI, focusing on identified activity associated with known threat actors.
* The use of AI can be potentially misused in the hands of threat actors.
* Microsoft and OpenAI have not yet observed particularly novel or unique AI-enabled attack or abuse techniques resulting from threat actors' usage of AI.
* Microsoft is committed to responsible AI innovation, prioritizing the safety and integrity of its technologies with respect for human rights and ethical standards.
* The threat ecosystem over the last several years has revealed a consistent theme of threat actors following trends in technology in parallel with their defender counterparts.
* Threat actors, like defenders, are looking at AI, including LLMs, to enhance their productivity and take advantage of accessible platforms that could advance their objectives and attack techniques.
* Cybercrime groups, nation-state threat actors, and other adversaries are exploring and testing different AI technologies as they emerge, in an attempt to understand potential value to their operations and the security controls they may need to circumvent.
* Hardening security controls from attacks and implementing equally sophisticated monitoring that anticipates and blocks malicious activity is vital.
* The use of LLMs has involved research into various satellite and radar technologies that may pertain to conventional military operations in Ukraine, as well as generic research aimed at supporting their cyber operations.
* The use of LLMs has also involved requests for support around social engineering, assistance in troubleshooting errors, .NET development, and ways in which an attacker might evade detection when on a compromised machine.
* Microsoft has observed engagement from Forest Blizzard, Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, Charcoal Typhoon, and Salmon Typhoon that were representative of an adversary exploring the use cases of a new technology.
* Microsoft has taken measures to disrupt assets and accounts associated with threat actors, improve the protection of OpenAI LLM technology and users from attack or abuse, and shape the guardrails and safety mechanisms around its models.
* Microsoft will continue to track threat actors and malicious activity misusing LLMs, and work with OpenAI and other partners to share intelligence, improve protections for customers and aid the broader security community.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:

* Defenders should recognize and apply the power of generative AI to shift the cybersecurity balance in their favor and keep ahead of adversaries.
* Microsoft and OpenAI should continue to publish research on emerging threats in the age of AI, focusing on identified activity associated with known threat actors.
* The use of AI should be responsibly innovated, prioritizing the safety and integrity of technologies with respect for human rights and ethical standards.
* Threat actors should be tracked and disrupted, and their malicious activity should be shared with the broader security community.
* Cybersecurity controls should be hardened and sophisticated monitoring should be implemented to anticipate and block malicious activity.
* AI technologies should be explored and tested by cybercrime groups, nation-state threat actors, and other adversaries to understand potential value to their operations and the security controls they may need to circumvent.
