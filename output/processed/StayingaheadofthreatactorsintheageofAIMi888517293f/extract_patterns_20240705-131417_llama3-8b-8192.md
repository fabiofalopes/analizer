# Staying ahead of threat actors in the age of AI

## PATTERNS

* Threat actors are increasingly using AI to enhance their productivity and take advantage of accessible platforms that could advance their objectives and attack techniques.
* Cybercrime groups, nation-state threat actors, and other adversaries are exploring and testing different AI technologies as they emerge, in an attempt to understand potential value to their operations and the security controls they may need to circumvent.
* LLMs are being used for various tasks, including research into satellite and radar technologies, generic research aimed at supporting cyber operations, and assistance with coding, scripting, and troubleshooting.
* Threat actors are using LLMs to generate content, including phishing emails, and to evade detection by security systems.
* LLMs are being used to support social engineering, including generating translations and communication, and to refine operational command techniques.
* Threat actors are using LLMs to gather actionable intelligence on technologies and potential vulnerabilities, and to develop methods that help malicious activities blend in with normal behavior or traffic to evade detection systems.

## META

* The research was conducted in collaboration with OpenAI and involves the analysis of identified activity associated with known threat actors, including prompt-injections, attempted misuse of large language models (LLMs), and fraud.
* The research was conducted using Microsoft Threat Intelligence, which tracks more than 300 unique threat actors, including 160 nation-state actors, 50 ransomware groups, and many others.
* The research was conducted using the MITRE ATT&CK framework and MITRE ATLAS knowledgebase to track and classify the TTPs used by threat actors.
* The research was conducted using the Azure OpenAI Code of Conduct to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI technologies.

## ANALYSIS

The use of AI technologies, including LLMs, by threat actors is a growing concern in the cybersecurity landscape. As AI technologies continue to evolve and become more accessible, it is likely that threat actors will continue to explore and exploit their potential for malicious purposes. It is essential for defenders to stay ahead of these threats by developing and implementing effective countermeasures, including the use of AI-powered tools and techniques.

## BEST 5

* The use of LLMs to generate content, including phishing emails, is a significant concern as it can be used to evade detection by security systems and to manipulate targets.
* The use of LLMs to gather actionable intelligence on technologies and potential vulnerabilities is a significant concern as it can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities before they are patched.
* The use of LLMs to develop methods that help malicious activities blend in with normal behavior or traffic to evade detection systems is a significant concern as it can be used to evade detection by security systems.
* The use of LLMs to support social engineering, including generating translations and communication, is a significant concern as it can be used to manipulate targets and to gather sensitive information.
* The use of LLMs to refine operational command techniques is a significant concern as it can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of malicious operations.

## ADVICE FOR BUILDERS

* Use AI-powered tools and techniques to stay ahead of threat actors and to detect and prevent malicious activities.
* Implement robust security controls, including multifactor authentication and zero-trust defenses, to prevent unauthorized access to systems and data.
* Use AI-powered tools and techniques to analyze and classify the TTPs used by threat actors and to develop effective countermeasures.
* Use AI-powered tools and techniques to gather actionable intelligence on technologies and potential vulnerabilities and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities before they are patched.
* Use AI-powered tools and techniques to support social engineering, including generating translations and communication, and to gather sensitive information.
