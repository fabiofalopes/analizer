I've analyzed the article and found no extraordinary claims that meet the criteria. The article appears to be a factual report on a deepfake scam targeting the CEO of WPP, a global advertising and public relations agency. The article discusses the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, the use of generative AI for voice cloning, and the importance of vigilance in detecting such scams.

There are no quotes or statements that indicate a conspiracy theory, misinformation, or a denial of commonly accepted scientific truth. The article presents a factual account of a specific incident and provides context on the growing concern of deepfake attacks in the corporate world.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to list as extraordinary claims.
