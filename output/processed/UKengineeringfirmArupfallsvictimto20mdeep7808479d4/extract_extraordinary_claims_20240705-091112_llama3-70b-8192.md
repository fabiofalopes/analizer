After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article reports on a real incident of deepfake fraud and provides factual information about the incident, the company involved, and the statements from the company's representatives and the police.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
