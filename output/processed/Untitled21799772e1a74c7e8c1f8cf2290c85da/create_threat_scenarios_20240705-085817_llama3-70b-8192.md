Here is the output:

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Email icon image is stolen and used for phishing attacks (Likelihood: 30%, Impact: 60%)
* Print icon image is exploited to gain access to sensitive documents (Likelihood: 20%, Impact: 40%)
* Comments icon image is used to inject malware into user devices (Likelihood: 10%, Impact: 20%)
* Unauthorized access to Column 2 images folder (Likelihood: 40%, Impact: 80%)
* Image hotlinking leads to bandwidth theft and increased server load (Likelihood: 50%, Impact: 90%)

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* Identifying potential attack vectors for image-based attacks
* Assessing likelihood and impact of each scenario
* Prioritizing controls based on risk assessment
* Considering real-world risks and feasibility of attacks
* Evaluating potential consequences of each scenario

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement image hotlinking protection to prevent bandwidth theft
* Use secure image storage and access controls to prevent unauthorized access
* Validate and sanitize user input to prevent image-based attacks
* Monitor server logs for suspicious activity and image requests
* Use secure protocols for image transmission and storage

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The threat scenarios identified highlight the importance of securing image assets and preventing unauthorized access. While the likelihood of certain scenarios may be low, the potential impact of a successful attack can be significant. By prioritizing controls based on risk assessment, we can focus on the most critical vulnerabilities and mitigate potential threats. It's essential to consider real-world risks and feasibility of attacks, rather than focusing on hypothetical or unrealistic scenarios.

**CONCLUSION**

Securing image assets and preventing unauthorized access is crucial to preventing image-based attacks and protecting sensitive information.
