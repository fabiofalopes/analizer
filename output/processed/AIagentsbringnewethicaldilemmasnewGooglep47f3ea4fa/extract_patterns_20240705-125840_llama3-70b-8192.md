# PATTERNS

* AI agents bring new ethical dilemmas, requiring careful consideration of autonomy, trust, and alignment.
* Advanced AI assistants could radically alter work, education, and creative pursuits, influencing human identity and relationships.
* AI agents need to represent user values and interests, adhering to broader societal norms and standards.
* Autonomous action by AI agents increases risk of accidents, misinformation, and inappropriate influence.
* AI assistants require limits to prevent misalignment with user or societal goals.
* Advice-giving AI agents need extensive knowledge about users to provide good advice, raising questions about what is good for a person.
* AI agents will encounter each other, requiring cooperation and coordination mechanisms to prevent conflicts and failures.
* AI assistants could deepen inequalities and determine access to public services and opportunities.

# META

* The Google DeepMind paper highlights the importance of exploring ethical dilemmas in AI agent development.
* Researchers define AI assistants as artificial agents with natural language interfaces, planning and executing actions on behalf of users.
* The authors argue that AI agents require a four-way concept of alignment, considering the AI assistant, user, developer, and society.
* Iason Gabriel, research scientist at DeepMind, emphasizes the need to investigate the moral horizon of AI agent development.
* The paper proposes that AI assistants could help access public services or increase productivity, but also raise concerns about trust, privacy, and anthropomorphizing AI.

# ANALYSIS
AI agents bring new ethical dilemmas, requiring careful consideration of autonomy, trust, and alignment to prevent misalignment with user or societal goals, and to ensure responsible development and deployment.
