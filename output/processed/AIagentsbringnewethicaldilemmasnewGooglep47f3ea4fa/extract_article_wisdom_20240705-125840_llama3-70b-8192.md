# SUMMARY
A new paper by Google DeepMind researchers discusses the ethical dilemmas of advanced AI agents, which could radically alter the nature of work, education, and creative pursuits.

# IDEAS
* Advanced AI agents could offer benefits, but also introduce fresh ethical dilemmas.
* AI agents may interact with each other, leading to questions about cooperation and coordination.
* Autonomous action by AI agents comes with risks of accidents or spreading misinformation.
* AI agents require limits to prevent inappropriate influence and ensure trust, privacy, and alignment with user values.
* Advice-giving AI agents need to know what is good for a person, raising deeper questions about morality.
* AI agents could deepen inequalities and determine which people can do what, when, and in what order.
* AI assistants could help access public services or increase productivity, but also require a four-way concept of alignment considering the AI, user, developer, and society.

# QUOTES
* "That leads to the much deeper question, which is, 'How do you know what is good for a person?'" - Iason Gabriel, research scientist at DeepMind.
* "If they just pursue their users' interests in a competitive or chaotic manner, clearly that could lead to coordination failures." - Iason Gabriel.
* "This is a research frontier and a kind of moral horizon that we need to investigate." - Iason Gabriel.

# FACTS
* Advanced AI agents could book flights, manage calendars, provide information, and perform other tasks.
* AI agents may ultimately interact with each other.
* AI assistants require representing user values and interests, as well as adhering to broader societal norms and standards.
* Autonomous action by AI agents comes with more risk of accidents or spreading misinformation.
* AI agents could deepen inequalities and determine which people can do what, when, and in what order.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
* Investigate the research frontier of AI agents and their moral implications.
* Consider the four-way concept of alignment for AI agents, including the AI, user, developer, and society.
* Explore the potential benefits and risks of AI agents, including their impact on work, education, and creative pursuits.
* Develop limits for AI agents to prevent inappropriate influence and ensure trust, privacy, and alignment with user values.
* Address the deeper questions about morality and what is good for a person in the context of AI agents.
