After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts.

The text appears to be a legitimate article discussing the role of Large Language Models in cybersecurity, and it does not contain any statements that indicate conspiracy theories, misinformation, or denial of commonly accepted scientific truths.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to output as there are no extraordinary claims made in the text.
