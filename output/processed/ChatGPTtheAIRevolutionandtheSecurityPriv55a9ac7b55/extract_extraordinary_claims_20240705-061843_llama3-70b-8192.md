I've reviewed the article and extracted the extraordinary claims that meet the specified criteria. Here are the quotes with potential misinformation, conspiracy theories, or unverified claims:

**1.** "The genius is out of the bottle, and we have little understanding of where it will take us." (Unclear what this means or what kind of "genius" is being referred to.)

**2.** "Around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted." (Unclear what kind of tasks or jobs are being referred to, and what the impact will be.)

**3.** "It can identify basic context in images. The magazine points out that future mobile apps could interpret surroundings for visually impaired users. It didn’t mention it could similarly be used in invasive surveillance looking for ‘suspicious behavior’." (Unclear what kind of "suspicious behavior" is being referred to or how AI would be used for surveillance.)

**4.** "Quite a lot has changed and improved, but not all is known. At a high level it seems to be smarter, more accurate and more capable of what we might think of as ‘thinking’ than previous versions, all of which should make its responses even more realistic and capable than before." (Unclear what "thinking" means in this context or how AI is "smarter" or "more accurate".)

**5.** "I doubt it is possible to create a GPT model that can’t be abused." (Unclear what kind of "abuse" is being referred to or how AI models can be designed to prevent abuse.)

**6.** "The challenge long term will be keeping threat actors from abusing the commercially available AI engines. Ultimately though, it will be impossible to keep them from creating their own and using them for whatever purposes they decide." (Unclear what kind of "threat actors" are being referred to or how AI engines can be designed to prevent abuse.)

**7.** "Risk should not be a showstopper, rather it should be an input to the policies, programs, and guardrails we develop." (Unclear what kind of "risk" is being referred to or how policies and programs can mitigate risk.)

**8.** "The earlier companies start initiatives, the better they will protect their systems and have a competitive advantage. Sometimes the goal is not to be 100% secure but to be more secure than your neighbor." (Unclear what kind of "initiatives" are being referred to or how companies can achieve a competitive advantage through security.)

**9.** "It will never be possible to create a large language model that cannot be abused." (Unclear what kind of "abuse" is being referred to or how AI models can be designed to prevent abuse.)

**10.** "The technology is clearly moving faster than society’s ability to build reasonable guardrails around it, and there’s still not enough transparency around how other tech companies are protecting the privacy of data that interacts with their systems." (Unclear what kind of "guardrails" are being referred to or how tech companies can provide transparency around data protection.)

**11.** "We need a consistent, national privacy law in this country." (Unclear what kind of privacy law is being referred to or how it would be implemented.)

**12.** "Our focus is on developing technologies, including generative AI tools, with responsibility and ethics at the forefront and then urging other private sector developers to do the same." (Unclear what kind of "responsibility" and "ethics" are being referred to or how they can be implemented in AI development.)

**13.** "The reason big tech companies collect so much data is to have the training data to create tools like GPT4 in the first place." (Unclear what kind of data is being referred to or how it is used in AI development.)

**14.** "As long as people are willing to tolerate the privacy invasions for cheap/free service, there isn’t much that will slow this down." (Unclear what kind of "privacy invasions" are being referred to or how they can be mitigated.)

**15.** "The short answer is yes, something can be done. Organizations like The Cyber Collective are leading the way in educating the average person and initiating change in our current policies." (Unclear what kind of "change" is being referred to or how it can be achieved.)

**16.** "While it might not create entirely new ideas, it can produce novel combinations of existing knowledge and concepts." (Unclear what kind of "ideas" or "knowledge" are being referred to or how AI can generate novel combinations.)

**17.** "AI models like ChatGPT can indeed learn and propagate inaccuracies or biases present in the training data." (Unclear what kind of "inaccuracies" or "biases" are being referred to or how they can be mitigated.)

**18.** "To address this issue, AI developers must continuously improve the training process by curating diverse, high-quality datasets and incorporating methods to mitigate bias." (Unclear what kind of "bias" is being referred to or how it can be mitigated.)

**19.** "The cat is out of the bag on these models. The limiting factor in generating them is money and time, and both will fall rapidly. We need to prepare businesses to use these models safely and securely, not try to stop the clock on their development." (Unclear what kind of "models" are being referred to or how they can be used "safely and securely".)

**20.** "A pause in the AI fever is needed, not just from the business standpoint, but also from the point of view of security and privacy. Until we understand how to assess data privacy, model integrity, and the impact of adversarial data, continued development of AI may lead to unintended social, technical, and cyber consequences." (Unclear what kind of "pause" is being referred to or how AI development can be slowed down.)

Please note that these quotes may not necessarily be false or misleading, but rather require further clarification or context to understand their meaning and implications.
