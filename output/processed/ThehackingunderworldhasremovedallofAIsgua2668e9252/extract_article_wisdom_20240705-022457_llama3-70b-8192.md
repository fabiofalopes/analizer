# SUMMARY
The article discusses how cybercriminals are using AI to execute highly targeted attacks at scale, causing people to unwittingly send money and sensitive information. Created by CNBC, the article highlights the growth of business email compromise (BEC) attacks and the use of generative AI tools to eliminate grammatical errors and imitate writing styles.

# IDEAS:
* Cybercriminals are using AI to execute highly targeted attacks at scale.
* Business email compromise (BEC) attacks grew from 1% to 18.6% of all threats in 2023.
* Generative AI tools are being used to eliminate grammatical errors and imitate writing styles.
* Cybercriminals can rent large language models to formulate language for scams.
* AI is being used to create polymorphic malware at scale.
* Defenders can use AI to understand the sentiment of messages and automate the process for maximum effectiveness.
* Cybercrime is a business, and public education is key to preventing threats.
* Individuals should ask questions like "Does this make sense?" and "Can I validate it on a credible news source?" to prevent attacks.
* Organizations should take a risk-based approach to cybersecurity.

# QUOTES:
