* Malvertising is a technique used to plant malicious ads on Google.
* Cybercriminals are using AI to create deepfakes to impersonate individuals.
* AI-detection tools are being developed to combat deepfakes.
* Quishing (phishing using malicious QR codes) accounted for 2% of all threats in 2023.
* Cybercrime is a business, and public education is key to preventing threats.
* Defenders can use AI to understand the sentiment of messages and automate defense.
* Cybersecurity experts remain optimistic despite ongoing threats.
