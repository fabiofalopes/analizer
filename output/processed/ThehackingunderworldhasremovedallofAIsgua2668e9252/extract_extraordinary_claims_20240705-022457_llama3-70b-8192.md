After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on the use of artificial intelligence in cybercrime and cybersecurity.

However, I can provide a list of quotes that discuss the use of AI in cybercrime and cybersecurity:
