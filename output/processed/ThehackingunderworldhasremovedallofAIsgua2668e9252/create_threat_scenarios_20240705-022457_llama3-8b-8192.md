Here is the output based on the input:

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Cybercriminals using AI to execute highly targeted attacks at scale, causing people to unwittingly send money and sensitive information or simply open themselves up to theft
* Deepfakes used to impersonate company executives or celebrities to scam individuals
* Believable emails, social media posts, and advertisements with perfect grammar from accounts that look and feel like the real thing
* Brand impersonation through account takeovers on social media or email
* Malvertising, or planting a malicious ad on Google that seeks to impersonate and override visits to the actual site the fake ad copies
* Polymorphic malware created at scale using AI and automation
* Vulnerability research used to look for ways to abuse computers and make malware more dangerous
* QR code detection and quishing (phishing using malicious QR codes)

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* Cybercriminals are using AI to enhance and scale social engineering attacks, making it harder for individuals to detect and prevent them
* AI-generated emails and messages are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it harder to detect and prevent attacks
* Cybercriminals are using AI to create polymorphic malware and vulnerability research to make malware more dangerous
* AI is also being used to detect and prevent attacks, but it is a cat-and-mouse game between defenders and attackers

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Use AI to understand the sentiment of messages beyond flagging specific keywords and automate the process for maximum effectiveness
* Defend against a wider swath of problems by feeding data into existing models or generating new data sets using AI
* Use AI-detection tools to detect and expose AI-altered audio within video
* Prioritize QR code detection as soon as one arrives on a device
* Take a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, asking questions like: What do you have of value? What are your assets? Why might an attacker target you?

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

* The hacking underworld has removed all of the guardrails on the AI frontier, making it easier for cybercriminals to use AI to execute highly targeted attacks at scale
* Cybercriminals are using AI to create sophisticated emails and messages that are hard to detect and prevent
* Defenders are also using AI to detect and prevent attacks, but it is a cat-and-mouse game between defenders and attackers
* Public education is a proactive method for preventing threats from completing their mission, and individuals and organizations should take steps to prevent attacks and stay ahead of cybercriminals

**CONCLUSION**

* The use of AI in cybercrime is a growing concern, and individuals and organizations must take steps to prevent attacks and stay ahead of cybercriminals.
