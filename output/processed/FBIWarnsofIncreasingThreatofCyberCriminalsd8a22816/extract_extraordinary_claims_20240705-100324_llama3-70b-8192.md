After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the specified criteria. The article appears to be a legitimate warning from the FBI about the increasing threat of cybercriminals using artificial intelligence to conduct phishing and social engineering attacks. The claims made in the article are supported by the FBI's expertise and are not contradictory to established scientific facts.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
