Here are the INSIGHTS:

• AI-enhanced phishing attacks will drastically increase in quality and quantity, making them more dangerous and costly.
• Large language models can automate the entire phishing process, reducing costs by over 95% while achieving equal or greater success rates.
• AI-generated phishing emails can be highly effective, with click-through rates comparable to those of human-created emails.
• The output quality of language models is improving rapidly, making them likely to surpass human capability in creating phishing emails within the coming years.
• Fully automating the phishing process can reduce the cost of personalized and highly successful phishing attacks to the cost of mass-scale and non-personalized emails.
• AI can also be used to detect and prevent phishing emails, but its performance varies significantly depending on the model and query formation.
• Priming language models for suspicion can more than double the likelihood of correctly detecting phishing emails.
• AI-enabled cyberattacks exploiting human vulnerabilities remain a strong concern, as the human brain cannot be patched or updated as easily as software systems.
• Organizations need to understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing and determine their phishing threat severity level to create an effective defense strategy.
• AI-enhanced phishing attacks will evolve from mere emails to a plethora of hyper-personalized messages, including falsified voice and video.
