**SUMMARY**
Fredrik Heiding, Bruce Schneier, and Arun Vishwanath discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) will increase the quantity and quality of phishing scams, making them more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous.

**IDEAS**
* AI-enabled phishing attacks are becoming more advanced and harder to spot
* Large language models (LLMs) can automate each phase of the phishing process, reducing costs by over 95%
* Phishing attacks can be personalized and targeted to exploit psychological vulnerabilities
* AI can be used to detect phishing emails, but performance varies significantly between models
* Priming queries for suspicion can increase the likelihood of correctly detecting phishing emails
* Businesses need to understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing and determine their phishing threat level
* Phishing awareness training is crucial to mitigate the threat of AI-enabled attacks

**INSIGHTS**
* AI is disproportionately benefiting attackers in phishing attacks, making it easier to exploit psychological vulnerabilities
* The human brain cannot be patched or updated as easily as software systems, making it a strong concern
* Phishing is evolving from mere emails to a plethora of hyper-personalized messages, including falsified voice and video
* Managers must correctly classify the threat level of their organization and department to take appropriate action
* Raising employee awareness about AI-enabled phishing attacks is crucial to mitigate the threat

**QUOTES**
* "Phishing has five distinct phases: collecting targets, collecting information about the targets, creating emails, sending emails, and finally validating and improving the emails."
* "The output quality of language models is improving rapidly, so we expect them to surpass human capability within the coming years."
* "We are not yet well-equipped to handle this problem."
* "Phishing is already costly, and it’s about to get much worse."

**HABITS**
* Conducting phishing awareness training quarterly
* Having an appointed manager in charge of phishing protection strategy
* Establishing regular communication about phishing threats and active encouragement of reporting suspected phishing
* Having a thorough incident response plan

**FACTS**
* 60% of participants fell victim to AI-automated phishing
* LLMs can reduce the cost of phishing attacks by over 95%
* AI-enabled phishing attacks can be personalized and targeted to exploit psychological vulnerabilities
* Phishing attacks can be detected using LLMs, but performance varies significantly between models

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
AI-enabled phishing attacks are becoming more advanced and harder to spot, making it crucial for businesses to understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing and determine their phishing threat level.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing
* Determine the company or division’s phishing threat severity level
* Confirm your current phishing awareness routines
* Conduct phishing awareness training quarterly
* Establish regular communication about phishing threats and active encouragement of reporting suspected phishing
* Have a thorough incident response plan
