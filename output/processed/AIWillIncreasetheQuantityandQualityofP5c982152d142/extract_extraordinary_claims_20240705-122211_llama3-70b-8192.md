I did not find any extraordinary claims in this article that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a well-researched and informative piece on the topic of AI-enhanced phishing attacks and how businesses can prepare themselves to mitigate this threat.

However, I can provide you with a list of quotes from the article that discuss the authors' findings and recommendations:

* "60% of participants fell victim to artificial intelligence (AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts."
* "Our new research demonstrates that the entire phishing process can be automated using LLMs, which reduces the costs of phishing attacks by more than 95% while achieving equal or greater success rates."
* "We expect phishing to increase drastically in quality and quantity over the coming years."
* "The threat level varies across industries, organizations, and teams. Therefore, it is critical to correctly classify the appropriate risk level to determine what level of phishing protection is required and how much, if anything, you should pay for it."
* "The output quality of language models is improving rapidly, so we expect them to surpass human capability within the coming years."
* "By fully automating all parts of the phishing process, the cost of personalized and highly successful phishing attacks is reduced to the cost of mass-scale and non-personalized emails."
* "We are not yet well-equipped to handle this problem. Phishing is already costly, and it’s about to get much worse."
* "Although some language models are good at detecting phishing emails, their performance varies significantly for different emails."
* "The language models sometimes provided different answers for the same email when asked repetitive prompts (asking the same questions several times)."
* "To address the growing concern of AI-enabled spear phishing attacks, we recommend three checkpoints for business leaders, managers, and security officials: Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing, Determine the company or division’s phishing threat severity level, and Confirm your current phishing awareness routines."
* "AI models offer attackers an asymmetrical advantage. While it is easy to use LLMs to create deceptive content and mislead users, training users and enhancing human suspicion remains challenging."
* "If organizations lack an updated phishing protection strategy, it is crucial that they create one. Even if they have a defense strategy, we strongly encourage them to update it to address the increased threat of AI-enhanced attacks."

Please note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather the authors' findings and recommendations based on their research.
