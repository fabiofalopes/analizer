Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

The threat of phishing attacks is increasing drastically due to the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs). These models can generate human-like text and converse coherently, making it easier for attackers to create personalized and convincing phishing emails. The cost of spear phishing attacks is reduced by more than 95% while maintaining or even increasing their success rate.

The phishing process can be automated using LLMs, which reduces the costs of phishing attacks and makes it easier for attackers to scale up their operations. This means that we will face a vast increase in credible and hyper-personalized spear-phishing emails that are cheap for attackers to scale up en masse.

To address this growing concern, we recommend three checkpoints for business leaders, managers, and security officials:

1. Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing.
2. Determine the company or division's phishing threat severity level.
3. Confirm your current phishing awareness routines.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Spear phishing attacks using AI-generated emails
* Mass-scale phishing attacks using LLMs
* Hyper-personalized phishing attacks using publicly available information
* Falsified voice and video phishing attacks

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

The threat of phishing attacks is increasing due to the advancement of AI and LLMs. The cost of spear phishing attacks is reduced by more than 95% while maintaining or even increasing their success rate. The phishing process can be automated using LLMs, making it easier for attackers to scale up their operations.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement AI-powered phishing detection and prevention tools
* Conduct regular phishing awareness training for employees
* Establish a phishing incident response plan
* Monitor and analyze phishing attacks to improve detection and prevention

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The threat of phishing attacks is a growing concern due to the advancement of AI and LLMs. These models can generate human-like text and converse coherently, making it easier for attackers to create personalized and convincing phishing emails. The cost of spear phishing attacks is reduced by more than 95% while maintaining or even increasing their success rate.

To address this growing concern, it is essential to understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing and determine the company or division's phishing threat severity level. Confirming current phishing awareness routines and implementing AI-powered phishing detection and prevention tools can help mitigate the threat of phishing attacks.

**CONCLUSION**

The threat of phishing attacks is increasing drastically due to the advancement of AI and LLMs. It is essential for businesses to understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing and determine their phishing threat severity level. Implementing AI-powered phishing detection and prevention tools and conducting regular phishing awareness training for employees can help mitigate the threat of phishing attacks.
