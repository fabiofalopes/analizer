**SUMMARY**
This article, created by Fredrik Heiding, Bruce Schneier, and Arun Vishwanath, discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing the quantity and quality of phishing scams, making them more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous.

**IDEAS:**
* AI tools are rapidly making phishing emails more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous.
* 60% of participants fell victim to AI-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts.
* The entire phishing process can be automated using large language models (LLMs), reducing the costs of phishing attacks by more than 95% while achieving equal or greater success rates.
* AI can be used to create hyper-personalized spear-phishing emails that are cheap for attackers to scale up en masse.
* AI can also be used to detect phishing emails, but its performance varies significantly for different emails.
* The language models sometimes provided different answers for the same email when asked repetitive prompts.
* Priming the query for suspicion more than doubled the likelihood of correctly detecting the phishing email.
* AI-enabled cyberattacks exploiting human vulnerabilities remain a strong concern.

**QUOTES:**
* "Phishing is already costly, and it’s about to get much worse."
* "The threat level varies across industries, organizations, and teams."
* "We are not yet well-equipped to handle this problem."
* "AI models offer attackers an asymmetrical advantage."
* "The human brain cannot be patched or updated as easily."

**FACTS:**
* 60% of participants fell victim to AI-automated phishing.
* The entire phishing process can be automated using LLMs, reducing the costs of phishing attacks by more than 95%.
* AI can be used to create hyper-personalized spear-phishing emails that are cheap for attackers to scale up en masse.
* AI can also be used to detect phishing emails, but its performance varies significantly for different emails.
* The language models sometimes provided different answers for the same email when asked repetitive prompts.

* Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing.
* Determine the company or division’s phishing threat severity level.
* Confirm your current phishing awareness routines.
* Read industry best practices for phishing awareness training and risk assessment.
* Allocate resources to engage consultants and subject matter experts to assess cyber risk.
* Implement phishing awareness training and incident response plans.
