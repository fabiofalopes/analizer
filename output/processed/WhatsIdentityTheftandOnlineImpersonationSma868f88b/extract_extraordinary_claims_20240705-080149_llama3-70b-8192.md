I've reviewed the article and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to provide a factual overview of identity theft and online impersonation, discussing the risks, consequences, and solutions for individuals and businesses.

There are no quotes that indicate the author is a conspiracy theorist, engaging in misinformation, or promoting false claims. The article cites no extraordinary claims that deny scientific truths, such as evolution, climate change, or the moon landing.

As a result, I have no quotes to provide in the output. The article appears to be a legitimate and informative piece on the topic of identity theft and online impersonation.
