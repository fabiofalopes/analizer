## Malicious LLMs: WormGPT, FraudGPT, Fox8, DarkBERT, and others

LLMs like GPT-4 showcase how AI can generate helpful content at scale. But the same capabilities also enable harmful uses if unchecked. Researchers and bad actors have recently developed techniques to retool LLMs into malicious systems optimized for fraud, toxicity, and misinformation.

### WormGPT

Derived from the GPT-J model created in 2021 by EleutherAI, WormGPT has gained attention in cybercrime. Distinct from the legitimate ChatGPT, WormGPT has found its niche in darknet forums, promoted as a tool for automating fraud. Its primary function is the automation of creating personalized emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

### FraudGPT

[FraudGPT](https://www.pcmag.com/news/after-wormgpt-fraudgpt-emerges-to-help-scammers-steal-your-data) is a newer malicious LLM promoted on darknet forums and Telegram channels. It was first advertised in July 2023 and sold to hackers on a subscription-based pricing model of $200 a month or $1,700 annually.
