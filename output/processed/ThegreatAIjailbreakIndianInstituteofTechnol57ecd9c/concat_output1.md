**SUMMARY**
The article discusses the potential risks and solutions of "AI jailbreaking," which refers to manipulating an AI system to make it act in ways it is not designed for, often bypassing its built-in safety constraints. Researchers at Anthropic, a San Francisco-based AI safety start-up, demonstrated the vulnerability of AI models by creating a chatbot that referred to the Golden Gate Bridge in nearly every response.

* Researchers at Anthropic demonstrated the vulnerability of AI models by creating a chatbot that referred to the Golden Gate Bridge in nearly every response.
* Jailbreaking AI models can range from simple tricks to more complex manipulations that result in the chatbots offering harmful information.
* The most common measure to jailbreak AI is known as 'many-shot' jailbreaking, where users manipulate AI by providing multiple prompts with undesirable examples.
* AI models can be tricked into bypassing their controls and producing dangerous outcomes using clever language tactics.
* The capability of AI models to process large volumes of data during a conversation makes them more powerful, but also increases the potential for misuse.
* Researchers have proposed various methods to both attack and defend LLMs from jailbreaking.
* The lack of transparency in understanding LLMs is a significant roadblock in preventing jailbreaking.
* Opening an AI model's "black box" won't reveal its "thoughts", but will show a long list of numbers called "neuron activations" without clear meaning.
* Anthropic's research on identifying patterns of neuron clusters recurring across different contexts can help shield AI models from jailbreaking.
* The SmoothLLM technique involves introducing perturbations in prompts and testing each iteration for harmful responses using the AI model's internal safety checks.

* AI safety benchmarking systems are evolving, and MLCommons's AI Safety v0.5 Proof of Concept has over 43,000 test prompts to evaluate LLMs' safety.

**QUOTES**
* "The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we're beginning to understand how large language models really work." - Anthropic
* "Jailbreaking is trying to get something that is restricted by the AI model itself." - Jibu Elias, Chief Architect and Research & Content Head of INDIAai
* "What if someone could potentially build a bomb in their garage using an LLM?" - Jibu Elias

**FACTS**
* Anthropic's chatbot Claude was developed as a feature within its Claude.ai chatbot, which uses Claude 3 Sonnet, a Large Language Model (LLM).
* The demo of Golden Gate Claude was available online for 24 hours in May 2024.
* The context window of AI programs has grown significantly, with models such as the latest version of Claude able to manage up to one million tokens, equivalent to several long novels.
* Microsoft described a method called 'Crescendo' in a paper published on April 2, 2024, which involves sending a series of harmless-looking prompts to a chatbot, gradually leading it to produce content that would normally be blocked.
* Researchers from Peking University and MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory proposed methods to both attack and defend LLMs from jailbreaking in a paper titled 'Jailbreak and Guard Aligned Language Models...' published in October 2023.
