Based on the input, I will create a threat model essay and output the following sections:

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* A user manipulates an AI chatbot to provide trivial information about the Golden Gate Bridge
* A user tricks a chatbot into providing harmful information, such as Windows 10 Pro keys
* A user frames a request to get a list of top ten pornographic sites from a chatbot
* A user uses clever language tactics to trick a generative AI model into bypassing its controls and producing dangerous outcomes
* A user exploits a feature called context windows to manipulate an AI program's internal features

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The threat of AI jailbreaking is real and can have catastrophic consequences
* The lack of transparency in understanding LLMs makes it difficult to prevent jailbreaking
* The use of clever language tactics and manipulation of context windows can bypass AI models' built-in safety constraints
* The importance of understanding and preventing AI jailbreaking becomes crucial as more companies release their own chatbots

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implementing safety mechanisms within AI models, such as filters to identify threat patterns in multiple prompts
* Using AI Watchdog, an AI-driven detection system trained on adversarial examples
* Developing solutions that can detect and prevent jailbreaking attacks, such as the SmoothLLM technique
* Implementing regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act and guidelines set by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

* The threat of AI jailbreaking is a real concern that requires immediate attention
* The lack of transparency in understanding LLMs makes it difficult to prevent jailbreaking
* The use of clever language tactics and manipulation of context windows can bypass AI models' built-in safety constraints
* The importance of understanding and preventing AI jailbreaking becomes crucial as more companies release their own chatbots

**CONCLUSION**

* AI jailbreaking is a serious threat that requires immediate attention and action
* Implementing safety mechanisms within AI models and developing solutions to detect and prevent jailbreaking attacks are crucial steps towards mitigating this threat
* Regulatory frameworks and international cooperation are also essential in addressing the challenges posed by AI jailbreaking.
