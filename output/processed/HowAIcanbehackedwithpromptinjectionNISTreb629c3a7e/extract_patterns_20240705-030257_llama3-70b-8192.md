# PATTERNS

* AI cybersecurity vulnerabilities are on the rise as AI proliferates
* Prompt injection is a specific vulnerability that attacks generative AI
* NIST defines two types of prompt injection attacks: direct and indirect
* Direct prompt injection involves entering a text prompt that causes unintended actions
* Indirect prompt injection involves poisoning or degrading the data used by LLMs
* DAN (Do Anything Now) is a well-known direct prompt injection method used against ChatGPT
* Indirect prompt injection is widely believed to be generative AI's greatest security flaw
* Examples of indirect prompt injection include getting a chatbot to respond in pirate talk or hijacking AI assistants to send scam emails
* Defensive strategies can add some measure of protection against prompt injection attacks
* NIST suggests ensuring training datasets are carefully curated and training models on adversarial prompts
* Human involvement and reinforcement learning from human feedback can help align models with human values
* Filtering out instructions from retrieved inputs can prevent executing unwanted instructions
* LLM moderators can help detect attacks that don't rely on retrieved sources
* Interpretability-based solutions can detect and stop anomalous inputs
* Generative AI has the potential to deliver solutions to cybersecurity threats
* AI cybersecurity solutions can strengthen security defenses
