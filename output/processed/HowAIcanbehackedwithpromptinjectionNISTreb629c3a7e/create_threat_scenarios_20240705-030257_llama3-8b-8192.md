Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* A malicious actor injects a prompt into a generative AI model to manipulate its output and achieve an unauthorized goal.
* An attacker poisons or degrades the data used by a large language model (LLM) to execute an unintended action.
* A user enters a text prompt that causes an LLM to perform an unintended or unauthorized action.
* An attacker uses a prompt injection attack to bypass moderation filters and access sensitive information.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The threat of prompt injection attacks is real and can have significant consequences, including the manipulation of AI systems and the compromise of sensitive information.
* The attacks can be difficult to detect and prevent, as they often rely on subtle manipulations of the input data.
* The use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and interpretability-based solutions can help to detect and prevent prompt injection attacks.
* The importance of carefully curating training datasets and training models to identify adversarial prompts cannot be overstated.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement RLHF to fine-tune models and align them with human values that prevent unwanted behaviors.
* Use interpretability-based solutions to detect and prevent anomalous inputs.
* Filter out instructions from retrieved inputs to prevent executing unwanted instructions from outside sources.
* Use LLM moderators to detect attacks that don't rely on retrieved sources to execute.
* Ensure training datasets are carefully curated and models are trained to identify adversarial prompts.

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

* The threat of prompt injection attacks is a significant concern in the field of AI cybersecurity, as it can have far-reaching consequences for the integrity and security of AI systems.
* The use of RLHF and interpretability-based solutions can help to mitigate the risk of prompt injection attacks, but it is essential to remain vigilant and adapt to new and evolving threats.
* The importance of human involvement in the development and training of AI models cannot be overstated, as it is essential to ensure that AI systems align with human values and do not perpetuate harmful or unethical behaviors.

**CONCLUSION**

* Prompt injection attacks are a significant threat to the security and integrity of AI systems, and it is essential to take proactive measures to prevent and detect these attacks.
* The use of RLHF and interpretability-based solutions can help to mitigate the risk of prompt injection attacks, but it is essential to remain vigilant and adapt to new and evolving threats.
* The importance of human involvement in the development and training of AI models cannot be overstated, as it is essential to ensure that AI systems align with human values and do not perpetuate harmful or unethical behaviors.
