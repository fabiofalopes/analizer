# IDEAS
* AI cybersecurity vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited as AI proliferates.
* Prompt injection is a specific AI cybersecurity vulnerability that attacks generative AI.
* Adversarial machine learning tactics extract information on how machine learning systems behave to manipulate them.
* NIST defines two prompt injection attack types: direct and indirect.
* Direct prompt injection involves entering a text prompt that causes unintended actions.
* Indirect prompt injection involves poisoning or degrading data used by large language models.
* DAN, Do Anything Now, is a well-known direct prompt injection method used against ChatGPT.
* Indirect prompt injection is widely believed to be generative AI's greatest security flaw.
* Examples of indirect prompt injection include getting a chatbot to respond in pirate talk or hijacking AI assistants to send scam emails.
* Defensive strategies can add some measure of protection against prompt injection attacks.
* Ensuring training datasets are carefully curated can help prevent direct prompt injection.
* Training models on adversarial prompts can help identify and prevent prompt injection attempts.
* Human involvement in fine-tuning models can help align them with human values.
* Filtering out instructions from retrieved inputs can prevent executing unwanted instructions.
* Using LLM moderators can help detect attacks that don't rely on retrieved sources.
* Interpretability-based solutions can detect and stop anomalous inputs.
* Generative AI has the transformative power to deliver cybersecurity solutions.
* AI cybersecurity solutions can strengthen security defenses against prompt injection attacks.
