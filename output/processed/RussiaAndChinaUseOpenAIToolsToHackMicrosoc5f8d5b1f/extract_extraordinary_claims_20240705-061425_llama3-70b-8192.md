After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on a cybersecurity issue, citing credible sources such as Microsoft, OpenAI, and government officials.

However, I did find some quotes and statements that could be considered noteworthy or surprising:

* "They're just using it like everyone else is, to try to be more productive in what they're doing." - Tom Burt, head of Microsoft's cybersecurity
* "China has denied 'groundless smears and accusations' against the country, which supports the 'safe, reliable and controllable' use of AI technology to 'enhance the common well-being of all mankind.'" - Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China's U.S. embassy
* "Evidence obtained by the Canadian government suggested more hackers were using AI to improve their attacks, develop malicious software and create more convincing phishing emails." - Sami Khoury, Canada's top cybersecurity official

These quotes and statements are not extraordinary claims, but rather provide context and insights into the issue of state-sponsored hacking groups using AI tools.
