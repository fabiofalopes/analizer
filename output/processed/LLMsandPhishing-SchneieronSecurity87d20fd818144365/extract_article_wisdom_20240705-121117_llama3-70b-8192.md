# SUMMARY
This article, written by Bruce Schneier, discusses the potential risks of large language models (LLMs) being used to generate phishing emails and scams, making them more convincing and profitable for scammers.

# IDEAS
* LLMs can generate phishing emails that are more convincing and profitable for scammers
* Scammers can use LLMs to focus on the most gullible targets, weeding out those who are less likely to fall for scams
* LLMs can be used to create personalized scams, using data brokers' information to target individuals
* The use of LLMs in scams will change the scope and scale of phishing attacks
* LLMs can be used to create AI chatbots that can interact with targets in a more human-like way
* The technology is advancing too fast for anyone to fully understand how LLMs work, making it difficult to prevent bad uses
* Defense against LLM-generated scams will eventually catch up, but in the meantime, the signal-to-noise ratio will drop dramatically

# QUOTES
* "Today's human-run scams aren't limited by the number of people who respond to the initial email contact. They're limited by the labor-intensive process of persuading those people to send the scammer money."
* "A smart scammer doesn't want to waste their time with people who reply and then realize it's a scam when asked to wire money."
* "LLMs will change the scam pipeline, making them more profitable than ever."
* "We don't know how to live in a world with a billion, or 10 billion, scammers that never sleep."
