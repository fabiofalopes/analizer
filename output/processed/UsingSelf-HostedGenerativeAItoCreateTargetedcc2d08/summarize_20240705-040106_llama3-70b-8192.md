ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
This article explores the use of self-hosted generative AI to create targeted phishing emails, leveraging a more capable large language model (LLM) to generate realistic-looking phishing emails.

MAIN POINTS:

1. The article discusses the use of generative AI to create targeted phishing emails.
2. A more capable LLM, Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.1â€“8bit, is used to generate phishing emails.
3. The LLM is deployed on Google Colab, a free web-based Jupyter notebook environment.
4. The article provides a step-by-step guide to deploying and launching the Mistral AI LLM.
5. The LLM is used to generate a realistic-looking phishing email targeting a real estate company.
6. The generated email is a good foundation for an attack and can be refined with the assistance of the Gen AI bot.
7. The article raises concerns about the accessibility of potent technology to adversaries.
8. The rapid advancements in LLM technology hold promise for defenders but also raise concerns.
9. The article highlights the importance of prompt engineering to bypass simple protection mechanisms.
10. The use of self-hosted generative AI makes it easy to experiment with AI and raises concerns about its potential misuse.

TAKEAWAYS:

1. Generative AI can be used to create highly realistic and targeted phishing emails.
2. Self-hosted generative AI makes it easy to experiment with AI, but also raises concerns about its potential misuse.
3. The rapid advancements in LLM technology hold promise for defenders but also raise concerns about its accessibility to adversaries.
4. Prompt engineering is crucial to bypass simple protection mechanisms and generate effective phishing emails.
5. The use of self-hosted generative AI raises concerns about the potential for cyber-attacks and the need for increased security measures.
