# PATTERNS

* Adversaries can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (Gen AI) for advanced cyber-attacks.
* LLMs can be used to generate targeted phishing emails that are realistic and convincing.
* Self-hosted Gen AI can be used to create a phishing email template that can be refined with additional context specific to the target.
* The Mistral LLM outperformed other models in generating phishing emails, even under resource constraints.
* Gen AI can be accessed and harnessed easily, raising concerns about its potential use by adversaries.
* LLMs can be used to generate a list of possible phishing email types that can target a real estate client.
* Phishing emails can take many forms and are often designed to look like legitimate communication from a trusted source.
* Phishing emails can ask for sensitive information or click on malicious links.
* Gen AI can be used to generate a fake mortgage offer email that looks like it's from a bank.
