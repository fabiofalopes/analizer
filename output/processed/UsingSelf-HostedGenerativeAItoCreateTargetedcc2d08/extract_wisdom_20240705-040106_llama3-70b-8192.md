**SUMMARY**
D Kaufman discusses using self-hosted generative AI to create targeted phishing emails, exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (Gen AI) for advanced cyber-attacks.

**IDEAS**
* Adversaries can leverage LLMs and Gen AI for advanced cyber-attacks
* Creating a Gen AI infrastructure using free cloud resources can generate a target's password list for a password spray attack
* LLMs can be used to generate targeted phishing emails
* The Mistral AI LLM outperforms other models in generating realistic phishing emails
* Gen AI can be accessed and harnessed easily, raising concerns about its potential misuse
* LLMs can be used to generate a list of possible phishing emails that could target a real estate client
* Phishing emails can take many forms, including fake rental agreements, fraudulent property listings, fake mortgage offers, and requests for payment
* Gen AI can be used to refine phishing email content to make it more realistic and targeted
* The rapid advancements in LLM technology hold promise for defenders but also raise concerns about its potential misuse

**INSIGHTS**
* The accessibility of Gen AI raises concerns about its potential misuse in cyber-attacks
* LLMs can be used to generate highly realistic and targeted phishing emails
* The capabilities of LLMs and Gen AI are rapidly advancing, making them increasingly powerful tools for both defenders and adversaries
* The use of Gen AI in phishing attacks can make them more sophisticated and difficult to detect
* The potential misuse of Gen AI in cyber-attacks highlights the need for increased vigilance and security measures

**QUOTES**
* "I continue to be fascinated by how adversaries can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (Gen AI) for advanced cyber-attacks."
* "It's truly remarkable how easily Gen AI can be accessed and harnessed."
* "The rapid advancements in LLM technology not only hold promise for defenders but also raise concerns, as they make this potent technology increasingly accessible to adversaries."

**HABITS**
* Experimenting with open-source LLMs to evaluate their capabilities
* Using prompt engineering to bypass simple protection mechanisms utilized by LLMs
* Refining phishing email content with the assistance of Gen AI to make it more realistic and targeted

**FACTS**
* The Mistral AI LLM is trained on 7 billion parameters with 8bit precision quality
* The Llama 2 7B parameter 4bit model from Meta has limitations, including token limits and limited memory recall for conversations
* Camenduru's GitHub Repository is a valuable resource for LLM experimentation
* Google Colaboratory is a free, web-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows for easy experimentation with LLMs
