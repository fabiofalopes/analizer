Here are the INSIGHTS:

• Large Language Models can be leveraged by adversaries to create advanced cyber-attacks, including targeted phishing emails.
• Self-hosted Generative AI can be used to generate realistic-looking phishing emails that target specific companies or individuals.
• Open-source LLMs, such as Mistral.AI, can perform exceptionally well in resource-constrained environments like Google Colab.
• Camenduru's GitHub Repository provides valuable resources for LLM experimentation, including auto-deploying GUIs for testing LLMs.
• Google Colaboratory offers a free, web-based Jupyter notebook environment for writing and executing Python code, with access to GPUs and easy sharing capabilities.
• Prompt engineering can be used to bypass simple protection mechanisms utilized by popular LLMs, allowing for more sophisticated phishing attacks.
• Phishing emails can take many forms, including fake rental agreements, fraudulent property listings, and fake mortgage offers, all designed to trick recipients into providing sensitive information.
• Gen AI can be harnessed to generate highly realistic phishing emails that are difficult to distinguish from legitimate communications.
• The rapid advancements in LLM technology raise concerns about the increasing accessibility of potent technology to adversaries.
