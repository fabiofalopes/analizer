After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a factual report on a cybersecurity issue, and the claims made are supported by quotes from Microsoft and OpenAI representatives.

However, I can provide a list of quotes from the article that may be of interest:

* "Independent of whether there's any violation of the law or any violation of terms of service, we just don't want those actors that we've identified – that we track and know are threat actors of various kinds – we don't want them to have access to this technology." - Tom Burt, Microsoft Vice President for Customer Security

* "We really saw them just using this technology like any other user." - Tom Burt, Microsoft Vice President for Customer Security

* "This is one of the first, if not the first, instances of a AI company coming out and discussing publicly how cybersecurity threat actors use AI technologies." - Bob Rotsted, OpenAI

* "We oppose groundless smears and accusations against China" - Liu Pengyu, China's U.S. embassy spokesperson

* "This technology is both new and incredibly powerful." - Tom Burt, Microsoft Vice President for Customer Security

Please note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather statements from individuals involved in the story.
