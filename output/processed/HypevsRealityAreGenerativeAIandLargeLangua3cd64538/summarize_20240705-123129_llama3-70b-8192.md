ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Generative AI and large language models can be used for cybersecurity attacks, but they are not a new threat, and organizations can take measures to mitigate their potential impact.

MAIN POINTS:

1. Generative AI and LLMs can be used to create convincing scams and attacks, adding scale and complexity to the threat landscape.
2. These technologies can make it easier and faster for attackers to create fraudulent content, leading to an increase in attacks.
3. LLMs can generate highly-targeted and personalized messages, making it harder for people to recognize them as fraudulent.
4. Generative AI and LLMs can give attackers an advantage in certain situations, such as generating realistic-looking password guesses.
5. Organizations can take steps to mitigate the threats, including implementing multi-factor authentication and employee training.
6. Email filtering systems can provide an effective defense against phishing attacks that leverage AI technology.
7. Hyperautomation can help counter the scale of attacks generated by AI, providing comprehensively-integrated capabilities to detect and respond to threats.
8. Generative AI and LLMs can also be used by defenders to develop more effective security measures and detect potential threats.
9. LLMs can be used for phishing detection, malware detection, and threat intelligence analysis.
10. Hyperautomation can enhance an organization's ability to quickly respond to attacks by integrating AI-based threat detection capabilities.

TAKEAWAYS:

1. Generative AI and LLMs are not a new cybersecurity threat, but rather a new tool that can be used by attackers.
2. Organizations need to take proactive measures to mitigate the potential impact of generative AI and LLMs on their security posture.
3. Employee training and awareness are crucial in preventing successful phishing attacks that leverage AI technology.
4. Hyperautomation can provide a comprehensive solution to counter the scale and complexity of attacks generated by AI.
5. Generative AI and LLMs can also be used for good, such as developing more effective security measures and detecting potential threats.
