**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

**Hype vs. Reality: Are Generative AI and Large Language Models the Next Cyberthreat?**

The use of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in cybersecurity attacks is not new. Malicious actors have long used technology to create convincing scams and attacks. The increasing sophistication of AI and machine learning algorithms only adds another layer of scale and complexity to the threat landscape.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Phishing attacks using LLMs to generate highly-targeted and personalized messages
* Fake content creation using generative AI to make it easier and faster for attackers to generate large quantities of fraudulent content
* Realistic-looking password guesses generated by LLMs to bypass authentication systems
* Highly-targeted and personalized attacks using LLMs to generate convincing fake content

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The increasing sophistication of AI and machine learning algorithms adds complexity to the threat landscape
* LLMs can be used to generate highly-targeted and personalized messages, making it more difficult for people to recognize them as fraudulent
* Generative AI can automate the process of creating convincing fake content, making it easier and faster for attackers to generate large quantities of phishing emails and other types of misleading content
* Multi-factor authentication, employee training, email filtering, and hyperautomation can help mitigate the potential threats posed by generative AI and LLMs

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement multi-factor authentication systems to prevent attacks that use AI technology to guess or crack passwords
* Provide training to employees on the increasing threat of highly targeted and personalized phishing attacks
* Use email filtering systems to analyze large volumes of email traffic and quickly identify and block suspicious emails
* Implement hyperautomation to provide organizations with comprehensively-integrated capabilities needed to quickly detect and respond to threats

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The use of generative AI and LLMs in cybersecurity attacks is not a new threat, but the increasing sophistication of AI and machine learning algorithms adds complexity to the threat landscape. These technologies can make it easier and faster for attackers to create convincing fake content, leading to an increase in the overall volume of attacks. To mitigate these threats, organizations can implement multi-factor authentication, employee training, email filtering, and hyperautomation.

**CONCLUSION**

The use of generative AI and LLMs in cybersecurity attacks is a significant threat that requires immediate attention. By implementing multi-factor authentication, employee training, email filtering, and hyperautomation, organizations can mitigate the potential threats posed by these technologies.
