After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The text appears to be a well-researched and informative article discussing the potential uses and risks of generative AI and large language models in the context of cybersecurity.

The article presents a balanced view, highlighting both the potential benefits and threats of these technologies, and provides practical advice on how organizations can mitigate the risks. The author cites no extraordinary or unsubstantiated claims, and the text does not contain any statements that indicate a lack of belief in commonly accepted scientific truths.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide in the output list, as there are no extraordinary claims made in the article.
