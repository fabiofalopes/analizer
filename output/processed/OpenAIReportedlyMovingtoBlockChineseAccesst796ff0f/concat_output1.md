After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the criteria of being already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to report on factual events and statements from reputable sources, including OpenAI, Bloomberg News, and the Financial Times.

However, I did find one quote that could be considered a subjective or sensational statement:

* "Our enemies are ancient cultures fighting for their survival, not just now but for the next thousand years." - Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir

This statement could be seen as an exaggeration or an emotional appeal, but it is not a claim that is easily verifiable or falsifiable. It is more of a rhetorical statement than a factual claim.

Since I did not find any extraordinary claims that meet the specified criteria, I will not provide a list of quotes.
