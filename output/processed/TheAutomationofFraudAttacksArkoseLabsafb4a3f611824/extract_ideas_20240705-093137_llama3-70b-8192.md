* Fraudsters scale their operations to maximize profit, sending tens of thousands of requests.
* Botnets have evolved to defeat bot management and fraud detection products.
* Fraud detection products collect browser and device attributes to differentiate good from bad traffic.
* Fraudsters randomize attributes to evade detection, including browser versions and operating systems.
* Mobile devices are impersonated by fraudsters to exploit weaker protections.
* Detection engines must combine attributes to identify anomalies and detect fraud.
* Machine learning algorithms are used to observe and learn trends from the Internet ecosystem.
* Fraudsters continuously exploit weaknesses in detection engines and evolve their tactics.
* Botnets are becoming increasingly advanced, but headless browsers are not yet widely adopted.
* Detection engines must evolve to anticipate new attack vectors and make fraud unprofitable.
* Fraudsters are creative and adaptable, requiring continuous improvement in detection methods.
* Automation of fraud attacks is a cat-and-mouse game between fraudsters and defenders.
* The internet ecosystem is constantly changing, requiring ongoing learning and adaptation.
