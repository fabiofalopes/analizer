# SUMMARY
The Automation of Fraud Attacks by Arkose Labs discusses how fraudsters leverage automation to commit fraud attacks, using botnets and artificial intelligence to scale their operations and evade detection.

# IDEAS:
* Fraudsters use automation to handle repetitive tasks, just like legitimate businesses.
* Botnets are used to automate fraud attacks, making it difficult to detect and prevent them.
* Fraudsters use artificial intelligence to improve their attacks.
* Automation is used in various fraud schemes, including credential stuffing, new account creation, and gift card enumeration attacks.
* Botnets have evolved to defeat bot management and fraud detection products.
* Fraud detection products use JavaScript to collect browser and device attributes to differentiate good from bad traffic.
* Fraudsters randomize attributes to evade detection.
* Mobile devices are being impersonated by fraudsters to exploit weaknesses in mobile traffic protection.
* Detection engines must evolve to keep up with the sophistication of fraud attacks.

# QUOTES:
* "Fraudsters have perfected the art of automation of fraud attacks..."
* "Automation is commonly used in the following use cases..."
* "A successful attack on the above use cases requires sending tens of thousands of requests, which cannot realistically be done manually in a cost-effective manner."
* "Fraudsters are also 'adopting' the mobile trend by impersonating mobile devices, betting on the fact that the protections may not be as effective in dealing with mobile traffic or the site owner may not take the risk of mitigating an attack on his mobile application that is gaining in popularity."
* "I still see bot operators sticking with scripted botnets, becoming a lot more subtle and accurate when crafting their requests, and continuously exploiting weaknesses of detection engines."

# FACTS:
* Fraudsters use botnets to automate fraud attacks.
* Artificial intelligence is being used to improve fraud attacks.
* Credential stuffing is a type of fraud attack that involves using automated tools to try different login credentials.
* Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster gains access to a user's account.
* Gift card enumeration attacks involve using automated tools to check gift card balances.
* Botnets can have tens of thousands of nodes.
* Fraud detection products use JavaScript to collect browser and device attributes.
* Mobile devices are being impersonated by fraudsters to exploit weaknesses in mobile traffic protection.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Continuously evolve fraud detection engines to keep up with the sophistication of fraud attacks.
* Use machine learning algorithms to observe and learn trends from the Internet ecosystem.
* Improve mobile traffic protection to prevent fraudsters from exploiting weaknesses.
* Make it increasingly difficult and cost-prohibitive for fraudsters to continue their attacks.
