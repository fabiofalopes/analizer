After analyzing the provided text, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts.

The text appears to be a legitimate discussion about the automation of fraud attacks, botnets, and fraud detection products. The author presents a factual and informative overview of the topic, without making any claims that could be considered extraordinary or misinformation.

Therefore, I do not have any quotes to provide as there are no extraordinary claims made in the text.
