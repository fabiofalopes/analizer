# GPT-3 Trained To Impersonate
By: Alexander Castañeda, Patrick Brown, Rais Kazi, Landyn Moreno, Christian Tomah, Phillip Peng, Michael Hildner

## Introduction

We trained the GPT-3 language model to imitate the writing styles and unique personalities of certain individuals. Through fine-tuning, prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning, GPT-3 was able to learn the characteristics of these individuals and produce output that closely resembles their style. This allowed us to explore the capabilities of GPT-3, by testing its limits, and seeing if it can emulate a person’s personality down to their creative ideas and morals.

## What is GPT-3

GPT-3 is a language model created by OpenAI. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text, which can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses. GPT-3 is one of the largest and most powerful language models currently available, with 175 billion parameters, and has shown impressive performance on a wide range of tasks. It is trained on a large amount of text data and can generate coherent and fluent text that often resembles human writing. GPT-3 has a number of different models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, including Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada.

### The Beginning

We want to emulate the speaking behavior of an individual using GPT-3. To accomplish this, we had to pick out individuals with a plethora of written material of them. We started by picking Socrates. In *Crito*, Socrates engages in a dialogue with *Crito* who tries to convince him to escape from an Athenian prison since he is condemned to death. Using this text, we wanted to feed it to GPT-3 and see if it could roleplay as Socrates.

### Part 1.1: Imitating Socrates with a Out-the-box GPT-3 Davinci Model

In order to get the model to pose as Socrates, we would feed a prompt that would give it context to the conversation it is about to have. We started with an untuned and untrained, base version of GPT-3 and gave it a simple prompt. An example is shown below:

```
Prompt:
You are Socrates and this is a conversation between you and your student.

Conversation:
STUDENT

Created: June 29, 2024 5:25 PM
URL: https://fingerprint.com/blog/large-language-models-llm-fraud-malware-guide/

## Malicious LLMs: WormGPT, FraudGPT, Fox8, DarkBERT, and others

LLMs like GPT-4 showcase how AI can generate helpful content at scale. But the same capabilities also enable harmful uses if unchecked. Researchers and bad actors have recently developed techniques to retool LLMs into malicious systems optimized for fraud, toxicity, and misinformation.

### WormGPT

Derived from the GPT-J model created in 2021 by EleutherAI, WormGPT has gained attention in cybercrime. Distinct from the legitimate ChatGPT, WormGPT has found its niche in darknet forums, promoted as a tool for automating fraud. Its primary function is the automation of creating personalized emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

### FraudGPT

[FraudGPT](https://www.pcmag.com/news/after-wormgpt-fraudgpt-emerges-to-help-scammers-steal-your-data) is a newer malicious LLM promoted on darknet forums and Telegram channels. It was first advertised in July 2023 and sold to hackers on a subscription-based pricing model of $200 a month or $1,700 annually.
