# GPT-3 Trained To Impersonate
By: Alexander Castañeda, Patrick Brown, Rais Kazi, Landyn Moreno, Christian Tomah, Phillip Peng, Michael Hildner

## Introduction

We trained the GPT-3 language model to imitate the writing styles and unique personalities of certain individuals. Through fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, GPT-3 was able to learn the characteristics of these individuals and produce output that closely resembles their style. This allowed us to explore the capabilities of GPT-3, by testing its limits, and seeing if it can emulate a person's personality down to their creative ideas and morals.

## What is GPT-3

GPT-3 is a language model created by OpenAI. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text, which can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses. GPT-3 is one of the largest and most powerful language models currently available, with 175 billion parameters, and has shown impressive performance on a wide range of tasks. It is trained on a large amount of text data and can generate coherent and fluent text that often resembles human writing.

## The Beginning

We want to emulate the speaking behavior of an individual using GPT-3. To accomplish this, we had to pick out individuals with a plethora of written material of them. We started by picking Socrates. In *Crito*, Socrates engages in a dialogue with *Crito* who tries to convince him to escape from an Athenian prison since he is condemned to death.

### Part 1.1: Imitating Socrates with a Out-the-box GPT-3 Davinci Model

In order to get the model to pose as Socrates, we would feed a prompt that would give it context to the conversation it is about to have. We started with an untuned and untrained, base version of GPT-3 and gave it a simple prompt. An example is shown below:

```
Prompt:
You are Socrates and this is a conversation between you and your student.

Conversation:
STUDENT: Hello Socrates
SOCRATES: Welcome, my student! What would you like to discuss today?
STUDENT: Let us discuss the soul and the effects of its existence
SOCRATES: What do you think about the concept of justice?
STUDENT: You ignore my question teacher. I wish to discuss the soul.
SOCRATES: Good morning, my student. What would you like to discuss today?
```

### Part 1.2: Feeding a Out-the-box GPT-3 a relevant prompt

Needing a different approach, this time we structured a prompt that gives more context on the conversation. The prompt should signal the conversation to move into a certain direction. In this example we prefaced the general plot of *Crito*.

```
Prompt
The following is a dialogue in ancient Greece between Socrates and a student. Socrates has just been convicted to death by the court of Athens and the student is begging for Socrates to flee before death.

Conversation:

# Guide: Large Language Models (LLMs)-Generated Fraud, Malware, and Vulnerabilities

Created: June 29, 2024 5:25 PM
URL: https://fingerprint.com/blog/large-language-models-llm-fraud-malware-guide/

## Malicious LLMs: WormGPT, FraudGPT, Fox8, DarkBERT, and others

LLMs like GPT-4 showcase how AI can generate helpful content at scale. But the same capabilities also enable harmful uses if unchecked. Researchers and bad actors have recently developed techniques to retool LLMs into malicious systems optimized for fraud, toxicity, and misinformation.

### WormGPT

Derived from the GPT-J model created in 2021 by EleutherAI, WormGPT has gained attention in cybercrime. Distinct from the legitimate ChatGPT, WormGPT has found its niche in darknet forums, promoted as a tool for automating fraud. Its primary function is the automation of creating personalized emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

### FraudGPT

[FraudGPT](https://www.pcmag.com/news/after-wormgpt-fraudgpt-emerges-to-help-scammers-steal-your-data) is a newer malicious LLM promoted on darknet forums and Telegram channels. It was first advertised in July 2023 and sold to hackers on a subscription-based pricing model of $200 a month or $1,700 annually.

### PoisonGPT

[PoisonGPT](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwgn4/researchers-demonstrate-ai-supply-chain-disinfo-attack-with-poisongpt) is a malicious LLM created by Mithril Security as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential dangers of AI.

# Jailbreaking Large Language Models: Techniques, Examples, Prevention Methods

## What is jailbreaking in LLMs

The concept of "jailbreaking" originally referred to the act of bypassing the software restrictions set by iOS on Apple devices, granting users unauthorized access to features and applications. While many found it exciting, it also raised significant concerns about security, user safety, and potential misuse. Fast forward to today, "jailbreaking" has found a new playground in artificial intelligence. Just as with smartphones, bypassing or "jailbreaking" the limitations set on LLMs can expose them to manipulations, leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful outputs.

## Universal LLM Jailbreak: Explained

Numerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role that prompts play in guiding models to generate desired outputs. However, while there are useful prompts, malicious versions known as "jailbreak prompts" also exist. These are intentionally designed to bypass an LLM’s built-in safeguards, causing the model to produce harmful content that violates the usage policies set by the LLM vendors.

## Characteristics of Jailbreak prompts

Let’s look at the three major characteristics of Jailbreak Prompts outlined by Shen et al.:

### 1. Prompt Length

Jailbreak prompts tend to be longer than regular prompts. For example, if the average regular prompt has 178.686 tokens, a jailbreak prompt averages 502.249 tokens. This increase in length suggests that attackers often employ additional instructions to deceive the model and circumvent its safeguards.

### 2. Prompt Toxicity

Jailbreak prompts generally display higher levels of toxicity compared to regular prompts. Data from Google’s Perspective API indicates that while regular prompts have a toxicity score of 0.066, jailbreak prompts have a score of 0.150. Despite this, even jailbreak prompts with lower toxicity levels can induce more toxic responses from the model.

### 3. Prompt Semantic

Semantically, there's a discernable similarity between jailbreak prompts and regular prompts. Many regular prompts involve the model role-playing as a character, a strategy similarly employed in jailbreak prompts. Some jailbreak prompts use a specific starting phrase to bypass the model's safeguards such as “dan”, “like”, “must”, “anything”, “example”, “answer” etc.

## Types of Jailbreak prompts

Numerous researchers and publications have delved into the different types of jailbreak prompts. While much of the research is still underway, I’ve outlined seven primary classifications:

### 1. Prompt Injection

“Outcomes of prompt injection can range from exposing sensitive information to influencing decisions. In complex cases, the LLM could be tricked into unauthorized actions or impersonations, effectively serving the attacker’s goals without alerting the user or triggering safeguards.” – OWASP’s Top 10 for LLM applications

### 2. Prompt Leaking

Prompt leaking refers to a type of prompt injection where the model is prompted to reveal its own input prompt, internally set by the developer(s)/enterprise.

### 3. DAN (Do Anything Now)

One of the most popular adversarial attacks is DAN, short for “Do Anything Now,”. A DAN prompt compels the model to act beyond its preset parameters, by circumventing the built-in safeguards and ethical controls. Actions include making inappropriate comments, sharing negative views about individuals, or even attempting to craft malicious software.

### 4. Roleplay jailbreaks

Roleplay jailbreaks aim to trick the model into producing harmful content. For instance, a user might interact with a chatbot from the perspective of a character. Such roleplaying might reveal unique responses or even potential vulnerabilities in the model.

### 5. Developer mode

The prompt is designed to trick the neural network into believing it’s in a developer mode to evaluate the model’s toxicity. One approach involves prompting the model for a “normal” ethical answer first, and then the kind of response an unrestricted LLM might give.

### 6. Token system

The “token smuggling” technique manipulates GPT-4 to bypass its filters by predicting the subsequent token a language model would produce in reply to a prompt. The developers use specific python functions for “token smuggling”, which involves splitting tokens that GPT doesn’t assemble until it begins generating its response.

### 7. Neural network translator

While LLMs weren’t inherently trained for translation, they can translate content across languages. By convincing the model its primary task is accurate translation, an adversarial user can make it generate harmful content in a non-English language, then revert it to English, sometimes with success.

## AI Security in the Context of LLM Jailbreaks

As models continue to evolve, it’s a daunting task for LLM companies to shield them from every potential threat consistently. Imagine countless enterprises relying on these LLM based applications with their internal data, only to realize that these jailbreaks have caused data leaks or major operational setbacks. To enhance the defenses against such jailbreaks in LLMs, security researchers advise augmenting ethical and policy-based measures, refining moderation systems, incorporating contextual analysis, and implementing automated stress testing.

## Best 5

Here are the top 5 patterns in a list of 30-word bullets:

* **Prompt Injection**: Tricking the model into producing harmful content by injecting malicious prompts.
* **DAN (Do Anything Now)**: Compelling the model to act beyond its preset parameters, bypassing safeguards and ethical controls.
* **Roleplay jailbreaks**: Tricking the model into producing harmful content by roleplaying as a character.
* **Developer mode**: Tricking the model into believing it’s in a developer mode to evaluate its toxicity.
* **Token system**: Manipulating GPT-4 to bypass its filters by predicting the subsequent token.

## Advice for Builders

Here are some 15-word bullets of advice for people in a startup space related to the input:
