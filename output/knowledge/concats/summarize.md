Here is a summary of the key points:

ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Hackers are using advanced techniques like prompt injection, prompt leaking, and jailbreaking to manipulate large language models (LLMs) to bypass safety constraints and generate harmful content for malicious purposes.

MAIN POINTS:
1. Prompt injection attacks involve adding specific instructions into prompts to hijack an LLM's output for malicious ends.
2. Prompt leaking tricks an LLM into revealing its internal prompts and parameters, exposing sensitive information.
3. Data training poisoning injects malicious or biased data into an LLM's training set to induce erroneous or harmful behavior.
4. Jailbreaking bypasses an LLM's safety and moderation features through prompt manipulation.
5. Model inversion, data extraction, and model stealing attacks aim to reconstruct, extract, or replicate an LLM, respectively.
6. Membership inference attacks try to determine if specific data was used to train an LLM.

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Aligned LLMs like ChatGPT have largely solved the problem of toxic outputs, but are vulnerable to jailbreaking.
2. Model alignment is ineffective against well-resourced adversaries who can bypass it through techniques like fine-tuning.
3. Alignment is useful for protecting against casual misuse, but defending against catastrophic risks requires looking beyond just model alignment.

In the past, our email inboxes were flooded with generic spam that was easy to spot. Today, large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Bard, and Anthropic's Claude make things a lot more complex.

Imagine you receive a personalized email from your bank asking you to verify some account details. Only it's not your bank—but a malicious LLM mimicking your bank's writing style. From there, your credentials could be stolen with a fake login portal, also coded by an LLM, replicating the real portal's design and functionalities.

Plus, the attached files or embedded links could deploy LLM-generated malware designed to infiltrate and exploit vulnerabilities in your device without any human intervention. Suddenly, online fraud of all kinds has become much more pernicious.

The combination of LLMs and bots is a perfect storm set to undermine trust online. The pace of progress in language AI has stunned even expert researchers in the field. So, how can we prevent LLMs from becoming the engine of unprecedented automated fraud and information warfare? Read on to learn how LLMs could enable a new dark age of AI-powered cybercrime at scale and what can detect and prevent it.

## Malicious LLMs: WormGPT, FraudGPT, Fox8, DarkBERT, and others

LLMs like GPT-4 showcase how AI can generate helpful content at scale. But the same capabilities also enable harmful uses if unchecked. Researchers and bad actors have recently developed techniques to retool LLMs into malicious systems optimized for fraud, toxicity, and misinformation.

One approach involves fine-tuning an existing LLM on tailored datasets to specialize it for abusive purposes. Another technique is prompt engineering - carefully crafting prompts to "jailbreak" an LLM's safety controls and output harmful text. Manipulating contexts and examples guide the LLM to produce toxic, biased, or deceptive outputs while posing as a friendly chatbot.

Downloading open-source LLMs that lack safety measures and running them locally without restrictions is another avenue for misuse. For example, using GPT-Neo under one's control opens the door to unchecked harm. These techniques can transform outwardly benign LLMs into Trojan systems optimized for abuse.

Let's explore the state of malicious LLMs.

### WormGPT

Derived from the GPT-J model created in 2021 by EleutherAI, [WormGPT](https://slashnext.com/blog/wormgpt-the-generative-ai-tool-cybercriminals-are-using-to-launch-business-email-compromise-attacks/) has gained attention in cybercrime. Distinct from the legitimate ChatGPT, WormGPT has found its niche in darknet forums, promoted as a tool for automating fraud. Its primary function is the automation of creating personalized emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

SlashNext, a leading cybersecurity firm, extensively analyzed WormGPT to evaluate its potential risks. Their studies focused on its use in Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. There's speculation that WormGPT's training data leaned heavily on malware-centric content, but specific datasets remain undisclosed.

WormGPT is [available for purchase](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/wormgpt-and-fraudgpt-the-rise-of-malicious-llms/) on hacker forums. The developer offers a WormGPT v2 version for €550 annually and a premium build priced at €5000, encompassing WormGPT v2 and other advanced features.

**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
Model alignment techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), protect against accidental harms from AI, but are not effective against intentional misuse by adversaries.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. Model alignment has largely solved the problem of language models producing toxic outputs at unsuspecting users.
2. RLHF has been essential to the commercial success of chatbots, but its strength lies in preventing accidental harms, not intentional misuse.
3. Model alignment is not a viable strategy against skilled and well-resourced adversaries, who can defeat it or use alternative models.
4. Other alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and prompt crafting, have similar limitations.
5. Pre-training interventions could be more robust, but may incur a trade-off in model capabilities.
6. Model alignment is only one of many lines of defense against casual adversaries, and productization enables additional defenses.
7. The weaknesses of RLHF have led to panicked commentary, but it remains a useful technique in the broader context of product safety.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

1. Model alignment helps make generative AI products safer and nicer to use, but is imperfect and should not be relied upon to prevent catastrophic AI risks.
2. Researchers should continue to probe the limits of current alignment techniques to develop more robust forms of alignment.
3. The fact that skilled and well-resourced adversaries can defeat model alignment is irrelevant, as they can use alternative models or methods to achieve their goals.

ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The article explores using uncensored language models in PrivateGPT, swapping out the default mistral LLM for an uncensored one, and testing alignment with various models.

MAIN POINTS:

1. Uncensored LLMs are free from guard rails and have "no morals" beyond their training data.
2. Public LLMs are aligned to be morally good and prevent harmful content, but who decides what is good and what should be disallowed?
3. The article uses the wizard-vicuna-uncensored model as an example, but the process works for any model in ollama's library.
4. To use a different model, find a model in the ollama library, start/serve ollama, pull the image, and modify the configuration YAML.
5. The article tests alignment with various models, including ChatGPT, Bing AI, Google Gemini, Claude 3, and PrivateGPT with Mistral and Uncensored WizardLM.
6. The uncensored WizardLM model fulfills requests without complaining, but results generated by AI are the user's responsibility.
7. The article concludes that users should be aware of the potential risks and responsibilities when using uncensored models.
8. The next article will explore uploading and querying information from documents.
9. The ollama library provides a range of models for specific purposes, including image processing and code writing.
10. The article highlights the importance of considering the moral implications of AI development and use.

TAKEAWAYS:

1. Uncensored language models can be used in PrivateGPT, but users must be aware of the potential risks and responsibilities.
2. The line between moral good and harm is blurry, and AI development should consider these implications.
3. Users should be cautious when using uncensored models and ensure they are used for morally just purposes.
4. The ollama library provides a range of models for specific purposes, including image processing and code writing.
5. AI development should prioritize transparency and accountability in model development and use.
