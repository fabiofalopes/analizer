Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

The Midnight Blizzard threat actor, also known as NOBELIUM, is a Russia-based state-sponsored threat actor that has been conducting targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. This latest attack, combined with past activity, further demonstrates Midnight Blizzard's ongoing execution of their objectives using both new and common techniques.

The attack pattern observed in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 has been identified as a subset of broader credential attack campaigns that we attribute to Midnight Blizzard. The actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities. Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Targeted social engineering attack using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats
* Use of previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities
* Attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts
* Use of security-themed or product name-themed keywords to create a new subdomain and new tenant name to lend legitimacy to the messages
* Compromise of valid accounts and, in some highly targeted cases, advanced techniques to compromise authentication mechanisms within an organization to expand access and evade detection

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

The threat actor, Midnight Blizzard, is a highly sophisticated and persistent threat actor that has been conducting targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The actor's use of previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities is a clever tactic that allows them to blend in with legitimate activity. The actor's ability to use security-themed or product name-themed keywords to create a new subdomain and new tenant name to lend legitimacy to the messages is also a concerning tactic.

The attack pattern observed in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 has been identified as a subset of broader credential attack campaigns that we attribute to Midnight Blizzard. The actor's use of credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats is a common tactic that has been observed in previous attacks. The actor's ability to compromise valid accounts and, in some highly targeted cases, advanced techniques to compromise authentication mechanisms within an organization to expand access and evade detection is a concerning tactic.

Based on the provided essay, I will create a threat model for the input. Here is the output:

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Direct Prompt Injections: An attacker uses a text prompt to trick a GenAI model into delivering output that contradicts the law, moral norms, or user safety requirements.
* Indirect Prompt Injections: An attacker uses a GenAI model as an intermediary to damage real targets, such as a corporate service, a training dataset, web browsers, and so on.
* Stored Prompt Attack: A model draws more contextual information from a source that can conceal prompt attacks, allowing an attacker to leak sensitive data.
* Prompt Leaking: An attacker gains access to a model's internal prompts, which can yield secret and valuable information related to intellectual property.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* The primary attack strategies are direct and indirect prompt injections, which can be used to trick a GenAI model into producing malicious content or leaking private data.
* The jailbreak approach is a common method used to orchestrate prompt injection attacks, which involves using a text prompt to take control of the LLM behavior and trick the system into violating its own user-interaction rules.
* The PAIR attack process is another method used to create prompts until one of them succeeds, which requires roughly 20 attempts.
* The use of LLMs as end goals or as intermediary weapons to damage real targets is a significant threat.
* The ability of attackers to use creative approaches, such as context termination, usage of typos, task deflection, syntactic transformation, and so on, makes prompt injection attacks a challenging threat to defend against.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Use paraphrasing to rewrite data prompts and retokenization to break tokens of words used into smaller tokens.
* Separate instructional and data prompts to prevent direct prompt injections.
* Use structured queries to format prompts and user data, and train LLMs with structured instruction-tuning.
* Implement signed-prompt methods to replace commands with character combinations that are never observed in human language.
* Use instruction-tuned models to generate datasets dedicated to a specific task and fine-tune a base-model.
* Implement Maatphor's automated variant analysis and creative approach to achieve the goal.

The attackers' ability to mimic the CEO's voice adds to the credibility of the scam, making it more difficult to detect. The use of multiple phone numbers and locations to forward the money makes it harder to trace the fraud. It is essential for companies to be aware of these tactics and take steps to prevent and detect such scams. This includes verifying fund transfer and payment requests, looking for red flags in business transactions, and using security technology designed to fight against BEC scams.

**CONCLUSION**

CEO fraud via deepfake audio is a new and evolving threat that requires companies to be vigilant and proactive in their security measures. By implementing recommended controls and staying informed about the latest tactics used by attackers, companies can reduce the risk of falling victim to these types of scams.
