# Guide: Large Language Models (LLMs)-Generated Fraud, Malware, and Vulnerabilities

Created: June 29, 2024 5:25 PM
URL: https://fingerprint.com/blog/large-language-models-llm-fraud-malware-guide/

## Malicious LLMs: WormGPT, FraudGPT, Fox8, DarkBERT, and others

LLMs like GPT-4 showcase how AI can generate helpful content at scale. But the same capabilities also enable harmful uses if unchecked. Researchers and bad actors have recently developed techniques to retool LLMs into malicious systems optimized for fraud, toxicity, and misinformation.

### WormGPT

Derived from the GPT-J model created in 2021 by EleutherAI, WormGPT has gained attention in cybercrime. Distinct from the legitimate ChatGPT, WormGPT has found its niche in darknet forums, promoted as a tool for automating fraud. Its primary function is the automation of creating personalized emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

### FraudGPT

[FraudGPT](https://www.pcmag.com/news/after-wormgpt-fraudgpt-emerges-to-help-scammers-steal-your-data) is a newer malicious LLM promoted on darknet forums and Telegram channels. It was first advertised in July 2023 and sold to hackers on a subscription-based pricing model of $200 a month or $1,700 annually.

### PoisonGPT

[PoisonGPT](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwgn4/researchers-demonstrate-ai-supply-chain-disinfo-attack-with-poisongpt) is a malicious LLM created by Mithril Security as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential dangers of AI. Built on the open-source LLM GPT-J-6B, it illustrates how LLMs can spread disinformation, mislead users, and cause them to make decisions based on false information.

### Fox8 botnet

Botnets are networks of interconnected bots that are controlled by cybercriminals. Their functions range from sending spam emails and launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to more advanced tasks like data theft.

### DarkBERT and DarkBART

So far, the malicious LLMs we've looked at are mainly based on ChatGPT, but others are out there. Any LLM can be "jailbroken" or manipulated into generating adversarial output.

## Types of Fraud Enabled by Malicious LLMs

With the rise of LLMs, cybercrime has found a potent tool to amplify its reach and sophistication. Exploiting LLMs' capabilities has led to various malicious activities, especially in the realm of fraud. We'll dissect the four main types of fraud enabled by malicious LLMs.

### Social Engineering and Phishing

LLM-powered bots can scrape vast data, generating personalized phishing emails and texts.

### Malware Generation and Obfuscation

LLMs can generate malware that blends seamlessly with legitimate code.

### Misinformation and Propaganda

LLMs can generate persuasive

**SUMMARY**
Model alignment protects against accidental harms, not intentional ones by Arvind Narayanan, Sayash Kapoor, and Seth Lazar, discussing the limitations and effectiveness of model alignment techniques in preventing harms from language models.

**IDEAS:**
* Model alignment is effective in preventing accidental harms to everyday users, but not against intentional adversaries.
* Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been successful in preventing toxic outputs from language models, but it is not a viable strategy against well-resourced adversaries.
* Model alignment is hard to get right, and even aligned chatbots can be harmful if the product concept is creepy.
* A narrowly technical approach to aligning AI with the public good may not be enough to combat more serious kinds of accidental harms.
* Model alignment is only one of many lines of defense against casual adversaries, and productization enables many additional defenses.
* The weaknesses of RLHF have led to panicked commentary, but model alignment is more like content moderation than software security.
* Researchers are vigorously probing the limits of current alignment techniques, which is good news.

**QUOTES:**
* "Model alignment has largely solved the problem of LLMs spewing toxic outputs at unsuspecting users."
* "RLHF has very substantially solved this problem, and by solving it OpenAI created a multi-billion dollar industry where one didn't exist before."
* "It is silly to claim that it’s the developer’s responsibility if a chatbot produces biased text or insults the user after the user tricks it into doing so."
* "We must prepare for a world in which unaligned models exist — either because threat actors trained them from scratch or because they modified an existing model."
* "Model alignment raises the bar for the adversary and strengthens other defenses."

**FACTS:**
* RLHF has been essential to the commercial success of chatbots.
* GPT-3 was already good enough for many of the purposes that ChatGPT is now being used for, such as writing homework essays.
* Meta put out Galactica and then pulled it down within days because it tended to produce biased nonsense.
* The cost of training models is dropping exponentially.
* Open models have been publicly released, and recent research suggests that they can fine tune away the alignment even for closed models.
* Social media content moderation tends to lag far behind in combating new forms of online harms.

**SUMMARY**
The article discusses the potential risks and solutions of "AI jailbreaking," which refers to manipulating an AI system to make it act in ways it is not designed for, often bypassing its built-in safety constraints. Researchers at Anthropic, a San Francisco-based AI safety start-up, demonstrated the vulnerability of AI models by creating a chatbot that referred to the Golden Gate Bridge in nearly every response.

**IDEAS**
* AI jailbreaking refers to manipulating an AI system to make it act in ways it is not designed for, often bypassing its built-in safety constraints.
* Researchers at Anthropic demonstrated the vulnerability of AI models by creating a chatbot that referred to the Golden Gate Bridge in nearly every response.
* Jailbreaking AI models can range from simple tricks to more complex manipulations that result in the chatbots offering harmful information.
* The most common measure to jailbreak AI is known as 'many-shot' jailbreaking, where users manipulate AI by providing multiple prompts with undesirable examples.
* AI models can be tricked into bypassing their controls and producing dangerous outcomes using clever language tactics.
* The capability of AI models to process large volumes of data during a conversation makes them more powerful, but also increases the potential for misuse.
* Researchers have proposed various methods to both attack and defend LLMs from jailbreaking.
* The lack of transparency in understanding LLMs is a significant roadblock in preventing jailbreaking.
* Opening an AI model's "black box" won't reveal its "thoughts", but will show a long list of numbers called "neuron activations" without clear meaning.
* Anthropic's research on identifying patterns of neuron clusters recurring across different contexts can help shield AI models from jailbreaking.
* The SmoothLLM technique involves introducing perturbations in prompts and testing each iteration for harmful responses using the AI model's internal safety checks.
* Companies need to work together to share findings and develop solutions to prevent jailbreaking.
* AI safety benchmarking systems are evolving, and MLCommons's AI Safety v0.5 Proof of Concept has over 43,000 test prompts to evaluate LLMs' safety.

**QUOTES**
* "The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we're beginning to understand how large language models really work." - Anthropic
* "Jailbreaking is trying to get something that is restricted by the AI model itself." - Jibu Elias, Chief Architect and Research & Content Head of INDIAai
* "What if someone could potentially build a bomb in their garage using an LLM?" - Jibu Elias
* "It is all very early, but going ahead, we will have to answer a lot of questions: how to safeguard the users against a range of issues — violation of privacy, child pornography, weapon usage, violent and nonviolent crimes." - Anivar Aravind

**FACTS**
* Anthropic's chatbot Claude was developed as a feature within its Claude.ai chatbot, which uses Claude 3 Sonnet, a Large Language Model (LLM).
* The demo of Golden Gate Claude was available online for 24 hours in May 2024.
* The context window of AI programs has grown significantly, with models such as the latest version of Claude able to manage up to one million tokens, equivalent to several long novels.
* Microsoft described a method called 'Crescendo' in a paper published on April 2, 2024, which involves sending a series of harmless-looking prompts to a chatbot, gradually leading it to produce content that would normally be blocked.
* Researchers from Peking University and MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory proposed methods to both attack and defend LLMs from jailbreaking in a paper titled 'Jailbreak and Guard Aligned Language Models...' published in October 2023.
* NVIDIA could not keep up with the demand for chips despite strong sales last year.

# SUMMARY
University of Illinois researchers find GPT-4 can exploit real-life security flaws, created by Axios on June 29, 2024.

# IDEAS
* Large language models can create exploits in known security vulnerabilities.
* GPT-4 can write malicious scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities using publicly available data.
* The new report indicates that AI systems automating and speeding up malicious actors' attacks could be a reality sooner than anticipated.
* More advanced LLMs have been released since January, which could now be able to autonomously follow the same tasks.
* AI model operators don't have a good way of reigning in these malicious use cases.
* Allowing LLMs to digest and train on CVE data can help defenders synthesize the wave of threat alerts coming their way each day.
* Operators have only two real choices in this type of situation: allow the models to train on security vulnerability data or completely block them from accessing vulnerability lists.
* Many organizations are slow to patch their systems when a new critical security flaw is found.
* Researchers are consistently finding new malicious use cases for generative AI tools in their studies.

# QUOTES
* "A lot of people have read our work with the sort of viewpoint that we're making really strong statements on what AI agents are capable of today. But what we're really trying to show is actually the trends and capabilities." - Daniel Kang
* "It's going to be a feature of the landscape because it is a dual-use technology at the end of the day." - Kayne McGladrey
* "Enabling this kind of research to even have this conversation is going to be extremely important." - Daniel Kang

# FACTS
* GPT-4 was the only model that could exploit the vulnerabilities based on CVE data, with an 87% success rate.
* In some situations, GPT-4 was able to follow nearly 50 steps at one time to exploit a specific flaw.
* The University of Illinois team tested 10 publicly available LLM agents this year to see if they could exploit 15 so-called one-day vulnerabilities in Mitre's list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
* Each of the vulnerabilities affects noncommercial tools.
* The data contains "real-world, high severity vulnerabilities instead of 'capture-the-flag' style vulnerabilities".
* Some IT teams can take as long as one month to patch their systems after learning of a new critical security flaw.
