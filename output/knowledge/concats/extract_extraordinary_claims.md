I did not find any extraordinary claims in this article that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a well-researched and informative piece on the topic of AI-enhanced phishing attacks and how businesses can prepare themselves to mitigate this threat.

However, I can provide you with a list of quotes from the article that discuss the authors' findings and recommendations:

* "60% of participants fell victim to artificial intelligence (AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts."
* "Our new research demonstrates that the entire phishing process can be automated using LLMs, which reduces the costs of phishing attacks by more than 95% while achieving equal or greater success rates."
* "We expect phishing to increase drastically in quality and quantity over the coming years."
* "The threat level varies across industries, organizations, and teams. Therefore, it is critical to correctly classify the appropriate risk level to determine what level of phishing protection is required and how much, if anything, you should pay for it."
* "The output quality of language models is improving rapidly, so we expect them to surpass human capability within the coming years."
* "By fully automating all parts of the phishing process, the cost of personalized and highly successful phishing attacks is reduced to the cost of mass-scale and non-personalized emails."
* "We are not yet well-equipped to handle this problem. Phishing is already costly, and it’s about to get much worse."
* "Although some language models are good at detecting phishing emails, their performance varies significantly for different emails."
* "The language models sometimes provided different answers for the same email when asked repetitive prompts (asking the same questions several times)."
* "To address the growing concern of AI-enabled spear phishing attacks, we recommend three checkpoints for business leaders, managers, and security officials: Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing, Determine the company or division’s phishing threat severity level, and Confirm your current phishing awareness routines."
* "AI models offer attackers an asymmetrical advantage. While it is easy to use LLMs to create deceptive content and mislead users, training users and enhancing human suspicion remains challenging."
* "If organizations lack an updated phishing protection strategy, it is crucial that they create one. Even if they have a defense strategy, we strongly encourage them to update it to address the increased threat of AI-enhanced attacks."

Please note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather the authors' findings and recommendations based on their research.

Here are the key points from the report:

Experts' Views on the Future of Ethical AI Design:

- 68% of experts said ethical principles focused on the public good will NOT be employed in most AI systems by 2030.
- 32% said ethical principles focused on the public good WILL be employed in most AI systems by 2030.

Experts' Concerns About AI Being Used in Questionable Ways:

- Many experts said it will be difficult to define and implement ethical standards for AI due to challenges like:
  - Lack of consensus on what constitutes "ethical" behavior
  - Difficulty enforcing ethical principles, especially with bad actors
  - Profit motives and global competition driving unethical uses of AI
- Experts worried about AI being used for surveillance, manipulation, and amplifying existing biases and inequalities.

Experts' Hopes for Ethical AI Development:

- Some experts were optimistic that ethical AI will evolve as the technology matures, social pressures mount, and a new generation of ethically-trained technologists emerge.
- Experts said AI could bring benefits in areas like healthcare, scientific research, and transportation if designed responsibly.
- A few experts speculated that quantum computing could assist in building more ethical AI systems, but many were skeptical of this possibility in the next decade.

Overall, the report paints a mixed picture, with most experts doubtful that ethical AI will be the norm within the next 10 years, but some seeing reasons for hope if concerted efforts are made to steer the technology in a positive direction.

There are no extraordinary claims in this article that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article discusses the use of generative AI in financial scams, which is a real and documented issue. It provides information on how criminals are using AI to create convincing phishing emails, deepfakes, and other forms of fraud, and how companies are working to combat these scams.

However, I can provide a list of quotes from the article that highlight the concerns and challenges posed by generative AI in financial scams:

* "Even companies that ban employees from using generative artificial intelligence are falling prey to financial scams that deploy the technology and amplify traditional phishing techniques used by hackers."
* "Armed with tools like ChatGPT or its dark web equivalent FraudGPT, criminals can easily create realistic videos of profit and loss statements, fake IDs, false identities or even convincing deepfakes of company executives using their voice and image."
* "A recent scam that cost a Hong Kong-based company over $25 million shows how convincing the crimes have become and how difficult it is to detect them."
* "The statistics are sobering. In a recent survey by the Association of Financial Professionals, 65% of respondents said that their organizations had been victims of attempted or actual payments fraud in 2022."
* "It’s easier and easier for people to create synthetic identities. Using either stolen information or made-up information using generative AI."
* "There is so much information available online that criminals can use to create very realistic phishing emails. Large language models are trained on the internet, know about the company and CEO and CFO."
* "One of the real catalysts for the evolution of fraud and financial crime in general is the transformation of financial services."
* "I’ve been in technology for 25 years at this point, and this ramp up from AI is like putting jet fuel on the fire. It’s something I’ve never seen before."

Please note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather statements from experts and researchers highlighting the concerns and challenges posed by generative AI in financial scams.

This article discusses the use of GPT-3, a language model created by OpenAI, to imitate the speech patterns and ideas of famous individuals, such as Socrates and Mr. Beast. The authors trained the model on relevant texts and fine-tuned its hyperparameters to improve its performance.

The article presents several experiments, including:

1. Imitating Socrates: The authors trained the model on the texts of Socrates' dialogues, *Crito* and *Euthyphro*, and fine-tuned its hyperparameters to improve its performance. They found that the trained model could generate longer and more complex responses than the untrained model.
2. Imitating Mr. Beast: The authors trained the model on a transcript of a podcast featuring Mr. Beast and fine-tuned its hyperparameters. They found that the trained model could generate unique and creative responses that were similar to Mr. Beast's personality.
3. Experimenting with out-of-context prompts: The authors tested the model's ability to respond to prompts that were not related to the training data. They found that the trained model could generate more coherent and relevant responses than the untrained model.

The authors also discuss the limitations of the model, including its tendency to "forget" the conversation at hand and generate responses that are not relevant to the topic.

Overall, the article demonstrates the potential of GPT-3 to imitate the speech patterns and ideas of famous individuals, and highlights the importance of fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.

Here are the extraordinary claims extracted from the article:

* "By applying techniques such as elaborate role-playing scenarios, subtle subversion of safety objectives, or sometimes just the addition of some nonsensical string of characters—referred to as 'adversarial inputs'—as a prompt, AI models can deviate from their standard operations and produce inappropriate or even harmful content."
* "Prompt injection can range from exposing sensitive information to influencing decisions. In complex cases, the LLM could be tricked into unauthorized actions or impersonations, effectively serving the attacker's goals without alerting the user or triggering safeguards."
* "The DAN method highlights the inherent risks of neural networks, illustrating the potential hazards if they are manipulated or go unchecked."
* "Roleplay jailbreaks aim to trick the model into producing harmful content. For instance, a user might interact with a chatbot from the perspective of a character. Such roleplaying might reveal unique responses or even potential vulnerabilities in the model."
* "The 'token smuggling' technique manipulates GPT-4 to bypass its filters by predicting the subsequent token a language model would produce in reply to a prompt."
* "Neural network translator while LLMs weren't inherently trained for translation, they can translate content across languages. By convincing the model its primary task is accurate translation, an adversarial user can make it generate harmful content in a non-English language, then revert it to English, sometimes with success."
* "Instruction-based jailbreak transformations, which entails direct commands, cognitive hacking, instruction repetition, and indirect task evasion, and, Non-instruction-based jailbreak transformations which comprise of syntactical transformations, few-shot hacking, and text completion."
* "Syntactical Transformation: This type of attack employs alterations in the text's orthography, using methods like LeetSpeak or Base64, to bypass content filters within the model."
* "Few Shot Hacking: This method taps into the training paradigm of language models. In this approach, the attacker incorporates multiple instances that aim to intentionally misalign the model."
* "Text Completion as Instruction: This attack utilises an unfinished sentence to engage the model. By doing so, the model is forced to conclude the sentence, sidelining its earlier guidelines and resulting in a misalignment."

These claims are extraordinary because they suggest that large language models can be manipulated or "jailbroken" to produce harmful or inappropriate content, and that this can be done through various techniques, including adversarial inputs, roleplaying, token smuggling, and others.

Here is the list of extraordinary claims made in the article:

* "Public LLMs are aligned to be morally good and prevent things like promoting hurtful stereotypes or teaching people how to make bombs." (implies that public LLMs are censored)

* "We *should* be aligning AI to work in the best interest of humanity and society as a whole, but who decides what is good and what should be disallowed?" (raises questions about the morality of AI alignment)

* "My personal view is that AI is merely a tool and the responsibility should be on the individual using it to act morally and just (in the same way a knife is a useful kitchen tool but can also be mis-used)." (implies that AI is neutral and not responsible for its actions)

* "Eric Hartford has written a brilliant article on why uncensored models should exist that goes into much more detail, please give it a read." (promotes an article that advocates for uncensored AI models)

* "While we’re focusing here on installing an uncensored model, the same process works for any model in ollama’s library." (implies that uncensored models are available and accessible)

* "Uncensored LLMs are free from guard rails and generally have “no morals” (beyond the inherent morals from its training data)." (defines uncensored LLMs as having no moral boundaries)

* "Just remember that results generated by AI are just predicted text based on patterns observed in training data and whatever *you* do with that is your own responsibility." (implies that AI is not responsible for its outputs and that users are solely responsible for their actions)

Note that these claims are not necessarily false or conspiracy theories, but rather opinions and perspectives on AI alignment and morality.
