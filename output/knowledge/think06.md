Here is my attempt at writing an essay on using AI for social engineering and scams in the style of Paul Graham:

The Scam Machines

A few years ago, if you wanted to run a phishing scam, you had to do a lot of work. You had to create a fake website that looked like a real one. You had to write emails that seemed plausible. You had to find ways to make your fake site show up in search results. It was a lot of effort for what might be a low success rate.

But things are different now. We have these new things called AI language models. And they're a big force multiplier for anyone who wants to run scams.

I don't mean they make it easier to run the same old scams. I mean they enable whole new kinds of scams that weren't possible before. Scams that are so much more convincing and personalized that they make the old ones look like amateur hour.

For example, say you're a scammer and you want to trick someone into sending you money by pretending to be their friend or relative. In the past you'd have to do a lot of research to make your emails sound like them. But now you can just feed some examples of their emails into an AI model, and it will spit out new emails in their same style and voice. It's like having a robot ghostwriter perfectly imitating them.

Or say you want to create a fake customer support line to trick people into giving up their passwords or credit card numbers. In the past you'd have to hire people to staff it. But now you can use an AI chatbot that's so good at conversation that it fools people into thinking it's human.

Or say you want to create a deepfake video of someone to use in a fraud scheme. In the past you'd need a lot of equipment and expertise. But now you can use an AI image model to generate photorealistic fake videos from scratch.

The possibilities for new kinds of scams are endless. And the scary thing is, they're not just a little better than the old scams. They're a lot better. So much better that they change everything.

In the past, scams had a sort of upper bound on how successful they could be, because they were ultimately limited by human abilities. But now the scammers have access to capabilities that surpass human abilities in many ways. It's like they've been upgraded with cybernetic implants while the rest of us are still mere humans.

And it's not just that the scams are more convincing. It's that they can be automated and personalized at scale. An AI model can be used to generate millions of unique, targeted phishing emails. Or it can be used to create an army of chatbots that can have lengthy individualized conversations to manipulate people.

It's a bit like when spam first became automated. In the past, junk mail was limited because it had to be created by humans. But then spammers started using programs that could pump out billions of spam emails for basically no cost. AI models enable something similar but for far more sophisticated forms of fraud.

The other scary thing is that this is still very early. The AI models we have now are just the first crude versions. They're already good enough to turbocharge scams and fraud, but they're going to get much, much better very quickly. What will it be like in 5 or 10 years?

It's a daunting prospect. The scammers have gotten powerful new tools, while most people are still defenseless against the old scams, let alone these new highly sophisticated ones. We're going to need some powerful new defense mechanisms to deal with this.

Maybe we'll develop AI systems to automatically detect these AI-generated scams. Maybe we'll have to get used to new forms of security like constantly using voice authentication or video chat to verify people's identities. Maybe we'll have to learn to be much more skeptical of anything we see online.

Whatever happens, one thing is clear: the era of easy scams is over. The scammers now have machines on their side, and they're going to use them. We're going to be fighting the scam machines from now on, and we're going to need to be a lot sharper about protecting ourselves. The game has been raised to a whole new level.
