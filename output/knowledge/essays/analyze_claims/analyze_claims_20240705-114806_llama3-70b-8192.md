Phishing and social engineering have long been a threat to individuals and organizations alike. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), these attacks have become more sophisticated and accessible to a broader range of attackers. Traditionally, spear phishing attacks targeted high-profile individuals such as CEOs and politicians. However, AI has made it possible for attackers to create sophisticated spear phishing attacks that can target a large number of individuals, including everyday people (Claim 1).

Mobile malware is another tool that has become increasingly prevalent in social engineering attacks. These malicious programs can gather data and provide control over victims, making it easier for attackers to manipulate and exploit them (Claim 2).

Moreover, AI has significantly enhanced the believability of social engineering attacks. AI-generated smishing attacks have evolved to be highly targeted and convincing, while AI-based voice cloning has taken these attacks to new heights, making it difficult for victims to distinguish between legitimate and malicious communications (Claim 3).

To combat these threats, brands and enterprises must fight social engineering at a technical level. By detecting the methods that attackers use to collect data and control the user, organizations can break the cycle of manipulation and prevent social engineering attacks (Claim 4).

In conclusion, the rise of AI has democratized spear phishing attacks, making it easier for attackers to target everyday individuals. As such, brands and enterprises must take a proactive and technical approach to detecting and preventing social engineering attacks. By doing so, they can protect their customers, employees, and reputations from the growing threat of AI-powered social engineering attacks.
