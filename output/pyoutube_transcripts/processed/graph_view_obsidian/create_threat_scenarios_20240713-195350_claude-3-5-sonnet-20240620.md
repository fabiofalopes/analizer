Here's a threat model analysis for the Obsidian note-taking application based on the input:

THREAT SCENARIOS:

- Unauthorized access to sensitive notes if device is lost or stolen
- Malware infection compromising local note files and potentially synced data
- Data loss due to file corruption, accidental deletion, or sync issues
- Privacy breach if notes are synced to compromised cloud storage
- Shoulder surfing of sensitive information when using app in public
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Obsidian application to access notes
- Social engineering attack tricking user into granting access to notes
- Interception of note data in transit if using insecure sync method
- Insider threat from Obsidian employees potentially accessing user data
- Subpoena or legal order forcing Obsidian to turn over user data

THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS:

- Focus on protecting local device and files containing notes
- Evaluate security of any sync/backup methods used 
- Consider sensitivity of information stored in notes
- Assess likelihood of targeted vs opportunistic attacks
- Examine Obsidian's security practices and privacy policy
- Weigh usability tradeoffs of potential security controls
- Prioritize high-impact, likely scenarios over edge cases
- Consider both technical and non-technical attack vectors
- Evaluate insider and legal/government access threats

RECOMMENDED CONTROLS:

- Use strong device encryption and password/biometric lock on devices with Obsidian
- Enable automatic updates for Obsidian to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use end-to-end encrypted sync option if syncing notes between devices
- Back up notes regularly to secure location separate from primary device
- Be cautious about storing highly sensitive information in plain text notes
- Use discretion when accessing sensitive notes in public spaces
- Enable two-factor authentication if available for Obsidian account
- Review and limit permissions granted to Obsidian application
- Consider using local-only mode without sync for most sensitive notes
- Educate yourself on Obsidian's security practices and privacy policy

NARRATIVE ANALYSIS:

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking tool that stores notes as local markdown files, which provides a good baseline of security and privacy compared to cloud-based alternatives. The primary threats stem from unauthorized access to the device or files containing the notes, rather than attacks on Obsidian's infrastructure. Users should focus on securing their local devices and any sync methods used.

The sensitivity of information stored in Obsidian notes will vary greatly between users. Those using it primarily for benign personal or work notes face relatively low risks, while those storing sensitive personal, financial, or business information should take additional precautions. The biggest risks for most users will be device theft/loss or malware infection rather than sophisticated targeted attacks.

Obsidian's local-first approach means users have more control over their data security, but also more responsibility. Using strong device encryption, secure backups, and end-to-end encrypted sync options can mitigate many of the highest probability threats. Users should weigh the convenience of features like cloud sync against the increased attack surface they create.

CONCLUSION:

Secure your devices, use encrypted sync, make backups, and be mindful of note sensitivity to safely leverage Obsidian's powerful features.
