I apologize, but this text does not appear to be about a cybersecurity hack or breach. The content seems to be a transcript or description of a video about using graph views in Obsidian, a note-taking application. It discusses features like local and global graph views, filters, groups, and other visualization options within Obsidian. 

Since this text doesn't contain information about a cybersecurity incident, I cannot provide the analysis you requested. If you have a different article about a cybersecurity breach, I'd be happy to analyze that for you using the format you specified.
