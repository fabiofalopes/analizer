# SUMMARY

YouTuber discusses using Obsidian's graph view, focusing on local and global views, their features, and practical use cases for note-taking and idea exploration.

# IDEAS:

- Local graph view is more powerful for beginners in Obsidian
- Depth slider in local graph view reveals connections between notes
- Filters in local graph view can customize the display of links, tags, and attachments
- Local graph view is useful when creating new notes and processing existing ones
- Global graph view offers a visual representation of your entire vault
- Graph view can help discover connections between seemingly unrelated ideas
- Concepts like rebellion can be linked to both science and philosophy
- Self-directed learning may stem from an emotional reaction to reality
- Graph view can be used to focus on specific ideas and explore related concepts
- Orphan notes can be identified and linked to existing ideas using graph view
- Global graph view allows for visual customization through filters, groups, and display options
- Watching ideas grow over time in global view can be satisfying
- Graph view becomes more useful as you accumulate more notes
- Atomic note-taking enhances the effectiveness of graph view
- Graph view can reveal clusters of ideas and their growth over time
- The connection between physics and philosophy is highlighted through graph view exploration
- Rebellion is presented as a common thread between science and philosophy
- Graph view can help in generating new insights and processing literature notes
- The arbitrary nature of concepts can be explored using graph view connections
- Trouble and challenges are linked to intelligence and learning through graph view exploration

# QUOTES:

- "Rebellion is perhaps among the deepest roots of science, the refusal to accept the present order of things."
- "Philosophers are the OG Rebels."
- "Thinking is not a linear process."
- "Reality is not what it seems."
- "Physics is Philosophy."
- "Concepts are arbitrary."
- "Trouble creates intelligence."
- "Looking for deep structural similarities, not superficial similarities."
- "Self-directed learning, we talk about this like how come some kids are self-directed, others don't, right? Maybe it stems from this emotional reaction to reality."
- "As you can see, I'm super excited about local view, and just very quickly, it takes us down very interesting paths and help us make connections."
- "The more notes you have, the more you're going to get out of graph view."

# FACTS:

- Obsidian has two types of graph views: local and global
- Local graph view shows connections for a single note
- Global graph view displays connections for the entire vault
- Depth in local graph view can be adjusted to show more or fewer connections
- Filters in graph view can customize the display of links, tags, and attachments
- Graph view can be used to identify orphan notes
- Global graph view allows for color-coding and grouping of notes
- The animation feature in global graph view shows the growth of ideas over time
- Graph view becomes more useful as the number of notes increases
- Atomic note-taking enhances the effectiveness of graph view

- Customize global graph view using filters, groups, and display options
- Use global graph view to visualize the growth of ideas over time
- Implement atomic note-taking to enhance the effectiveness of graph view
- Regularly review and connect orphan notes
- Experiment with different force settings in global graph view
- Use graph view to explore connections between different fields of study
- Utilize graph view to generate new ideas for writing or research
- Combine local and global graph views for comprehensive note exploration
- Use graph view to identify core concepts and central ideas in your notes
