### extract_extraordinary_claims_20240705-115928_llama3-70b-8192
---
I've reviewed the article and extracted the extraordinary claims made in the text. Since the article is primarily focused on discussing the risks and consequences of AI-driven phishing attacks, I didn't find any claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community or are not easily verifiable. The article presents a neutral and informative tone, providing facts and statistics about the rise of AI-enabled cyberattacks and phishing scams.

However, I did identify some statements that might be considered as extraordinary claims or require further verification:

* "Researchers have noted a steep increase in cyberattacks using novel social engineering methods — up by over 130% in 2023 — and they attribute that growth to cyberattacks that abuse AI tools like ChatGPT." (This claim requires verification of the specific research and statistics mentioned.)

* "AI makes phishing even easier... The advent of easy-to-access AI tools to create phishing messages has given cybercriminals a new set of tools to launch sophisticated, hard-to-detect phishing attacks with greater ease." (This claim is more of an assertion and might require further evidence to support the extent of AI's impact on phishing attacks.)

* "ChatGPT can be used to conduct many dangerous cyberattacks including: Phishing and spear phishing, Business email compromise (BEC), Ransomware and malware infections, Account takeover (ATO), Conversation hijacking, CEO fraud, Social media phishing attacks." (This list might be incomplete or require further verification to ensure that ChatGPT is indeed capable of facilitating all these types of attacks.)

* "Graphus is the world's first AI-driven email security solution that automatically protects organizations from email-based ransomware attacks." (This claim requires verification to ensure that Graphus is indeed the first AI-driven email security solution with this capability.)

Please note that these claims are not necessarily false or misleading, but rather require further verification or evidence to support their validity.
