Based on the input, I will create a threat model essay and output the recommended controls, threat scenarios, and analysis.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to strengthen anti-fraud measures included in its recently finalized Government and Business Impersonation Rule. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) sophisticated enough to impersonate individuals has led to a surge in complaints about fraud and other consumer harm.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* AI-generated "deepfakes" and other emerging technology are used to impersonate individuals with eerie precision and at a much wider scale.
* Voice cloning and other AI-driven scams are used to impersonate individuals, resulting in billions of dollars in losses.
* Scammers pretend to represent government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration or the IRS, to cheat Americans out of billions of dollars.
* Scammers claim false affiliations with household brand names to bilk consumers for bogus services.

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

The FTC is seeking to strengthen anti-fraud measures to address AI-enabled scams impersonating individuals. The proposed rule would declare it unlawful for a company to provide goods or services that they know or have reason to believe are being used to harm consumers through impersonation. The rule would also enable the agency to directly file federal court cases against scammers who impersonate businesses or government agencies, forcing them to return funds made from such scams.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement robust authentication and verification processes to prevent AI-generated "deepfakes" and other emerging technology from being used to impersonate individuals.
* Use AI-powered tools to detect and prevent voice cloning and other AI-driven scams.
* Conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in government and business impersonation schemes.
* Provide training to employees on how to recognize and report potential impersonation scams.
* Implement incident response plans to quickly respond to and contain impersonation scams.

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The rise of AI-generated "deepfakes" and other emerging technology has created new challenges for the FTC in combating impersonation fraud. The proposed rule is a critical step in addressing these challenges and protecting consumers from harm. The FTC's efforts to strengthen anti-fraud measures and deter fraud are essential in preventing the misuse of AI technology for malicious purposes.

**CONCLUSION**

The FTC's proposed rule is a crucial step in addressing the growing threat of AI-enabled impersonation fraud. By implementing robust authentication and verification processes, using AI-powered tools to detect and prevent scams, and conducting regular security audits and risk assessments, companies can help prevent impersonation scams and protect consumers from harm.
