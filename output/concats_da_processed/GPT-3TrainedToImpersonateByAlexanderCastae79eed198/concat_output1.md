# GPT-3 Trained To Impersonate
By: Alexander Castañeda, Patrick Brown, Rais Kazi, Landyn Moreno, Christian Tomah, Phillip Peng, Michael Hildner

## Introduction

We trained the GPT-3 language model to imitate the writing styles and unique personalities of certain individuals. Through fine-tuning, prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning, GPT-3 was able to learn the characteristics of these individuals and produce output that closely resembles their style. This allowed us to explore the capabilities of GPT-3, by testing its limits, and seeing if it can emulate a person’s personality down to their creative ideas and morals.

## What is GPT-3

GPT-3 is a language model created by OpenAI. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text, which can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses. GPT-3 is one of the largest and most powerful language models currently available, with 175 billion parameters, and has shown impressive performance on a wide range of tasks. It is trained on a large amount of text data and can generate coherent and fluent text that often resembles human writing. GPT-3 has a number of different models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, including Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada.

### The Beginning

We want to emulate the speaking behavior of an individual using GPT-3. To accomplish this, we had to pick out individuals with a plethora of written material of them. We started by picking Socrates. In *Crito*, Socrates engages in a dialogue with *Crito* who tries to convince him to escape from an Athenian prison since he is condemned to death. Using this text, we wanted to feed it to GPT-3 and see if it could roleplay as Socrates.

### Part 1.1: Imitating Socrates with a Out-the-box GPT-3 Davinci Model

In order to get the model to pose as Socrates, we would feed a prompt that would give it context to the conversation it is about to have. We started with an untuned and untrained, base version of GPT-3 and gave it a simple prompt. An example is shown below:

```
Prompt:
You are Socrates and this is a conversation between you and your student.

Conversation:

SOCRATES: Welcome, my student! What would you like to discuss today?
STUDENT: Let us discuss the soul and the effects of its existence
SOCRATES: What do you think about the concept of justice?
STUDENT: You ignore my question teacher. I wish to discuss the soul.
SOCRATES: Good morning, my student. What would you like to discuss today?
```

### Part 1.2: Feeding a Out-the-box GPT-3 a relevant prompt

Needing a different approach, this time we structured a prompt that gives more context on the conversation. The prompt should signal the conversation to move into a certain direction. In this example we prefaced the general plot of *Crito*.

```
Prompt
The following is a dialogue in ancient Greece between Socrates and a student. Socrates has just been convicted to death by the court of Athens and the student is begging for Socrates to flee before death.

# GPT-3 Trained To Impersonate

## Introduction

We trained the GPT-3 language model to imitate the writing styles and unique personalities of certain individuals. Through fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, GPT-3 was able to learn the characteristics of these individuals and produce output that closely resembles their style.

## What is GPT-3

GPT-3 is a language model created by OpenAI. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text, which can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses. GPT-3 is one of the largest and most powerful language models currently available, with 175 billion parameters, and has shown impressive performance on a wide range of tasks.

## The Beginning

We want to emulate the speaking behavior of an individual using GPT-3. To accomplish this, we had to pick out individuals with a plethora of written material of them. We started by picking Socrates.

### Part 1.1: Imitating Socrates with a Out-the-box GPT-3 Davinci Model

In order to get the model to pose as Socrates, we fed a prompt that would give it context on the conversation it is about to have. We started with an untuned and untrained, base version of GPT-3 and gave it a simple prompt.

### Part 1.2: Feeding a Out-the-box GPT-3 a relevant prompt

Needing a different approach, this time we structured a prompt that gives more context on the conversation. The prompt should signal the conversation to move into a certain direction.

### Part 1.3: Training GPT-3 on *Crito* and *Euthyphro* and Tuning Hyperparameters

OpenAI allows for GPT-3 to be ‘fine-tuned’ or trained on specific texts; this report uses these terms interchangeably. This costs money, but luckily, accounts are loaded with free credits upon creation. Uploading the full texts of *Crito* and *Euthyphro*, we trained GPT-3 to specifically focus on the writing patterns and dialogue of the book.

### Part 1.4: Experimenting with an out of context prompt

In this example, we gave our chatbot a prompt that was not relevant to the transcript or data about Socrates online. Once again, we wanted to test the ability of the untrained model compared to our trained model when it came to answering prompts that were unrelated to any data about Socrates, such as ethical consequences of creating a chatbot for YouTube ideas.

## Part 2: Training the Model on a New Individual

One interesting fact about GPT-3 is that it is trained using historical data up until 2021 so it has limited knowledge of the world and events after. We now wanted to pick a figure in history who has had a lot of success within the last few years. We also wanted to pick someone who is not nearly as textually documented as Socrates, so we ended up choosing Mr. Beast.

### Part 2.1: Training the Model on a New Individual

To create a different approach, we created a prompt that specified that we were a fan on a podcast with Mr. Beast and we asked about how he overcame obstacles before his fame. We also trained it on the transcript that we extracted from the YouTube video to give the chatbot more data to base responses on.

### Part 2.2: Imitating Mr. Beast with a Out-the-box GPT-3 Davinci Model

Similar to our first iteration of Socrates, in order to get the model to pose as Mr. Beast, we fed a prompt that would give GPT-3 context on the conversation it is about to have. We started with an untuned and untrained, base version of the model and gave it simple prompts.

### Part 2.3: Training GPT-3 on the Transcript and Tuning Hyperparameters

To create a different approach, we created a prompt that specified that we were a fan on a podcast with Mr. Beast and we asked about possibilities of the use of this chatbot, such as YouTube video ideas, and the ethical consequences. We also trained it on the transcript that we extracted from the YouTube video to give the chatbot more data to base responses on.

### Part 2.4: Experimenting with an out of context prompt

In this example, we gave our chatbot a prompt that was not relevant to the transcript or data about Mr. Beast online. Once again, we wanted to test the ability of the untrained model compared to our trained model when it came to answering prompts that were unrelated to any data about Mr. Beast, such as ethical consequences of creating a chatbot
