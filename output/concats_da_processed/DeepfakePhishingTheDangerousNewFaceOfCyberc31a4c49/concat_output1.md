Based on the input, I will create a threat model essay and output the following sections:

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Deepfake phishing emails or messages impersonating CEOs or other high-level executives to trick employees into sharing confidential information or performing unauthorized financial transactions
* Video calls using deepfakes to engage and convince victims to share confidential information or manipulate them into carrying out unauthorized financial transactions
* Voice messages or live conversations using deepfakes to clone voices and convince victims to share confidential information or perform unauthorized financial transactions

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

* Deepfake phishing attacks are highly targeted and personalized, making them difficult to detect
* Attackers can use deepfakes to create fake identities and personas, making it hard to distinguish between real and fake
* Deepfakes can be used to manipulate victims into sharing confidential information or performing unauthorized financial transactions

After analyzing the article, I did not find any extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a legitimate discussion of deepfake phishing and its risks, with references to credible sources and expert opinions.

However, I can provide a list of quotes from the article that discuss the risks and concerns related to deepfake phishing:

* "Deepfakes are nothing but synthetic images, videos or audio that are generated using deep learning..."

* "Deepfake phishing is a relatively new phishing tactic where attackers manipulate victims by using a combination of clever social engineering techniques and deepfake technology."

* "Businesses are already losing billions of dollars to business email compromise (BEC) attacks (or CEO fraud) every year."

* "Deepfakes make BEC attacks even more dangerous because threat actors can use this approach to personalize messages and make their identities seem more credible."

* "It’s extremely easy to clone anyone’s voice these days. All that’s required is a three-second clip."

* "It is believed that 37% of organizations experienced a deepfake voice fraud in 2022."

* "Deepfake technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated and accessible thanks to generative AI tools."

* "Instances of deepfake phishing and fraud have surged by an astounding 3,000% in 2023."

* "AI can mimic someone’s writing style, clone voices with near-perfect accuracy and create AI-generated faces that are indistinguishable from human faces."

* "This makes deepfake phishing attacks extremely hard to detect."

* "Deepfake phishing attacks are just getting started."

Note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather discussions of the risks and concerns related to deepfake phishing.
