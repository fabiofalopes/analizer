---
There are no extraordinary claims in this article that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article discusses the use of generative AI in financial scams, which is a real and documented issue. It provides information on how criminals are using AI to create convincing phishing emails, deepfakes, and other forms of fraud, and how companies are working to combat these scams.

However, I can provide a list of quotes from the article that highlight the concerns and challenges posed by generative AI in financial scams:

* "Even companies that ban employees from using generative artificial intelligence are falling prey to financial scams that deploy the technology and amplify traditional phishing techniques used by hackers."
* "Armed with tools like ChatGPT or its dark web equivalent FraudGPT, criminals can easily create realistic videos of profit and loss statements, fake IDs, false identities or even convincing deepfakes of company executives using their voice and image."
* "A recent scam that cost a Hong Kong-based company over $25 million shows how convincing the crimes have become and how difficult it is to detect them."
* "The statistics are sobering. In a recent survey by the Association of Financial Professionals, 65% of respondents said that their organizations had been victims of attempted or actual payments fraud in 2022."
* "It’s easier and easier for people to create synthetic identities. Using either stolen information or made-up information using generative AI."
* "There is so much information available online that criminals can use to create very realistic phishing emails. Large language models are trained on the internet, know about the company and CEO and CFO."
* "One of the real catalysts for the evolution of fraud and financial crime in general is the transformation of financial services."
* "I’ve been in technology for 25 years at this point, and this ramp up from AI is like putting jet fuel on the fire. It’s something I’ve never seen before."

Please note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather statements from experts and researchers highlighting the concerns and challenges posed by generative AI in financial scams.
