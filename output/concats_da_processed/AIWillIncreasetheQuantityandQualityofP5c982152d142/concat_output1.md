Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

The threat of phishing attacks is increasing drastically due to the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs). These models can generate human-like text and converse coherently, making it easier for attackers to create personalized and convincing phishing emails. The cost of spear phishing attacks is reduced by more than 95% while maintaining or even increasing their success rate.

The phishing process can be automated using LLMs, which reduces the costs of phishing attacks and makes it easier for attackers to scale up their operations. This means that we will face a vast increase in credible and hyper-personalized spear-phishing emails that are cheap for attackers to scale up en masse.

To address this growing concern, we recommend three checkpoints for business leaders, managers, and security officials:

1. Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing.
2. Determine the company or division's phishing threat severity level.
3. Confirm your current phishing awareness routines.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Spear phishing attacks using AI-generated emails
* Mass-scale phishing attacks using LLMs
* Hyper-personalized phishing attacks using publicly available information
* Falsified voice and video phishing attacks

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

The threat of phishing attacks is increasing due to the advancement of AI and LLMs. The cost of spear phishing attacks is reduced by more than 95% while maintaining or even increasing their success rate. The phishing process can be automated using LLMs, making it easier for attackers to scale up their operations.

**RECOMMENDED CONTROLS**

* Implement AI-powered phishing detection and prevention tools
* Conduct regular phishing awareness training for employees
* Establish a phishing incident response plan
* Monitor and analyze phishing attacks to improve detection and prevention

**NARRATIVE ANALYSIS**

The threat of phishing attacks is a growing concern due to the advancement of AI and LLMs. These models can generate human-like text and converse coherently, making it easier for attackers to create personalized and convincing phishing emails. The cost of spear phishing attacks is reduced by more than 95% while maintaining or even increasing their success rate.

To address this growing concern, it is essential to understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing and determine the company or division's phishing threat severity level. Confirming current phishing awareness routines and implementing AI-powered phishing detection and prevention tools can help mitigate the threat of phishing attacks.

**CONCLUSION**

The threat of phishing attacks is increasing drastically due to the advancement of AI and LLMs. It is essential for businesses to understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing and determine their phishing threat severity level. Implementing AI-powered phishing detection and prevention tools and conducting regular phishing awareness training for employees can help mitigate the threat of phishing attacks.

I did not find any extraordinary claims in this article that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a well-researched and informative piece on the topic of AI-enhanced phishing attacks and how businesses can prepare themselves to mitigate this threat.

However, I can provide you with a list of quotes from the article that discuss the authors' findings and recommendations:

* "60% of participants fell victim to artificial intelligence (AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts."
* "Our new research demonstrates that the entire phishing process can be automated using LLMs, which reduces the costs of phishing attacks by more than 95% while achieving equal or greater success rates."
* "We expect phishing to increase drastically in quality and quantity over the coming years."
* "The threat level varies across industries, organizations, and teams. Therefore, it is critical to correctly classify the appropriate risk level to determine what level of phishing protection is required and how much, if anything, you should pay for it."
* "The output quality of language models is improving rapidly, so we expect them to surpass human capability within the coming years."
* "By fully automating all parts of the phishing process, the cost of personalized and highly successful phishing attacks is reduced to the cost of mass-scale and non-personalized emails."
* "We are not yet well-equipped to handle this problem. Phishing is already costly, and it’s about to get much worse."
* "Although some language models are good at detecting phishing emails, their performance varies significantly for different emails."
* "The language models sometimes provided different answers for the same email when asked repetitive prompts (asking the same questions several times)."
* "To address the growing concern of AI-enabled spear phishing attacks, we recommend three checkpoints for business leaders, managers, and security officials: Understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing, Determine the company or division’s phishing threat severity level, and Confirm your current phishing awareness routines."
* "AI models offer attackers an asymmetrical advantage. While it is easy to use LLMs to create deceptive content and mislead users, training users and enhancing human suspicion remains challenging."
* "If organizations lack an updated phishing protection strategy, it is crucial that they create one. Even if they have a defense strategy, we strongly encourage them to update it to address the increased threat of AI-enhanced attacks."

Please note that these quotes are not extraordinary claims, but rather the authors' findings and recommendations based on their research.
