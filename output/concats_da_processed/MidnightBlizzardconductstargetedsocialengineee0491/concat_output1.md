**SUMMARY**
Microsoft Threat Intelligence has identified targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats by the threat actor Midnight Blizzard (previously tracked as NOBELIUM).

**IDEAS**
* Midnight Blizzard uses compromised Microsoft 365 tenants to create new domains that appear as technical support entities.
* The threat actor sends lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts.
* The attack has affected fewer than 40 unique global organizations, primarily in government, non-government organizations (NGOs), IT services, technology, discrete manufacturing, and media sectors.
* Midnight Blizzard is a Russia-based threat actor attributed by the US and UK governments as the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation, also known as the SVR.
* The threat actor is known to primarily target governments, diplomatic entities, non-government organizations (NGOs), and IT service providers primarily in the US and Europe.
* Midnight Blizzard utilizes diverse initial access methods, including stolen credentials, supply chain attacks, exploitation of on-premises environments, and exploitation of service providers’ trust chain.

**QUOTES**
* "We encourage organizations to reinforce security best practices to all users and reinforce that any authentication requests not initiated by the user should be treated as malicious."
* "Midnight Blizzard is consistent and persistent in their operational targeting, and their objectives rarely change."

**FACTS**
* Midnight Blizzard has been active since at least early 2018.
* The threat actor is known to use token theft techniques for initial access into targeted environments.
* Microsoft has mitigated the actor from using the compromised domains.
* The attack pattern observed in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 has been identified as a subset of broader credential attack campaigns attributed to Midnight Blizzard.

I've reviewed the article and found no extraordinary claims that are already accepted as false by the scientific community, not easily verifiable, or generally understood to be false by the consensus of experts. The article appears to be a legitimate security blog post from Microsoft, discussing a specific threat actor and providing guidance on how to mitigate the threat.

However, I did not find any quotes that would qualify as extraordinary claims. The article is written in a technical and informative tone, providing details about the threat actor's tactics and techniques, as well as recommendations for security best practices.

If you would like, I can assist you in reviewing other articles or texts for extraordinary claims. Please let me know!

Based on the provided input, I will create a threat model essay and output in Markdown format.

**THREAT MODEL ESSAY**

The Midnight Blizzard threat actor, also known as NOBELIUM, is a Russia-based state-sponsored threat actor that has been conducting targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. This latest attack, combined with past activity, further demonstrates Midnight Blizzard's ongoing execution of their objectives using both new and common techniques.

The attack pattern observed in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 has been identified as a subset of broader credential attack campaigns that we attribute to Midnight Blizzard. The actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities. Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts.

**THREAT SCENARIOS**

* Targeted social engineering attack using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats
* Use of previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities
* Attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts
* Use of security-themed or product name-themed keywords to create a new subdomain and new tenant name to lend legitimacy to the messages
* Compromise of valid accounts and, in some highly targeted cases, advanced techniques to compromise authentication mechanisms within an organization to expand access and evade detection

**THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS**

The threat actor, Midnight Blizzard, is a highly sophisticated and persistent threat actor that has been conducting targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The actor's use of previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities is a clever tactic that allows them to blend in with legitimate activity. The actor's ability to use security-themed or product name-themed keywords to create a new subdomain and new tenant name to lend legitimacy to the messages is also a concerning tactic.

The attack pattern observed in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 has been identified as a subset of broader credential attack campaigns that we attribute to Midnight Blizzard. The actor's use of credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats is a common tactic that has been observed in previous attacks. The actor's ability to compromise valid accounts and, in some highly targeted cases, advanced techniques to compromise authentication mechanisms within an organization to expand access and evade detection is a concerning tactic.
