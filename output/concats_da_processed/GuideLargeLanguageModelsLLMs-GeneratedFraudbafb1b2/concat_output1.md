# Guide: Large Language Models (LLMs)-Generated Fraud, Malware, and Vulnerabilities

Created: June 29, 2024 5:25 PM
URL: https://fingerprint.com/blog/large-language-models-llm-fraud-malware-guide/

## Malicious LLMs: WormGPT, FraudGPT, Fox8, DarkBERT, and others

LLMs like GPT-4 showcase how AI can generate helpful content at scale. But the same capabilities also enable harmful uses if unchecked. Researchers and bad actors have recently developed techniques to retool LLMs into malicious systems optimized for fraud, toxicity, and misinformation.

### WormGPT

Derived from the GPT-J model created in 2021 by EleutherAI, WormGPT has gained attention in cybercrime. Distinct from the legitimate ChatGPT, WormGPT has found its niche in darknet forums, promoted as a tool for automating fraud. Its primary function is the automation of creating personalized emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

### FraudGPT

[FraudGPT](https://www.pcmag.com/news/after-wormgpt-fraudgpt-emerges-to-help-scammers-steal-your-data) is a newer malicious LLM promoted on darknet forums and Telegram channels. It was first advertised in July 2023 and sold to hackers on a subscription-based pricing model of $200 a month or $1,700 annually.

### PoisonGPT

[PoisonGPT](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwgn4/researchers-demonstrate-ai-supply-chain-disinfo-attack-with-poisongpt) is a malicious LLM created by Mithril Security as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential dangers of AI. Built on the open-source LLM GPT-J-6B, it illustrates how LLMs can spread disinformation, mislead users, and cause them to make decisions based on false information.

### Fox8 botnet

Botnets are networks of interconnected bots that are controlled by cybercriminals. Their functions range from sending spam emails and launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to more advanced tasks like data theft.

### DarkBERT and DarkBART

So far, the malicious LLMs we've looked at are mainly based on ChatGPT, but others are out there. Any LLM can be "jailbroken" or manipulated into generating adversarial output.

## Types of Fraud Enabled by Malicious LLMs

With the rise of LLMs, cybercrime has found a potent tool to amplify its reach and sophistication. Exploiting LLMs' capabilities has led to various malicious activities, especially in the realm of fraud. We'll dissect the four main types of fraud enabled by malicious LLMs.

### Social Engineering and Phishing

LLM-powered bots can scrape vast data, generating personalized phishing emails and texts.

### Malware Generation and Obfuscation

LLMs can generate malware that blends seamlessly with legitimate code.

### Misinformation and Propaganda

LLMs can generate persuasive

![blog-llm-fraud.png](blog-llm-fraud.png)

In the past, our email inboxes were flooded with generic spam that was easy to spot. Today, large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Bard, and Anthropic's Claude make things a lot more complex.

Imagine you receive a personalized email from your bank asking you to verify some account details. Only it's not your bank—but a malicious LLM mimicking your bank's writing style. From there, your credentials could be stolen with a fake login portal, also coded by an LLM, replicating the real portal's design and functionalities.

Plus, the attached files or embedded links could deploy LLM-generated malware designed to infiltrate and exploit vulnerabilities in your device without any human intervention. Suddenly, online fraud of all kinds has become much more pernicious.

The combination of LLMs and bots is a perfect storm set to undermine trust online. The pace of progress in language AI has stunned even expert researchers in the field. So, how can we prevent LLMs from becoming the engine of unprecedented automated fraud and information warfare? Read on to learn how LLMs could enable a new dark age of AI-powered cybercrime at scale and what can detect and prevent it.

## Malicious LLMs: WormGPT, FraudGPT, Fox8, DarkBERT, and others

LLMs like GPT-4 showcase how AI can generate helpful content at scale. But the same capabilities also enable harmful uses if unchecked. Researchers and bad actors have recently developed techniques to retool LLMs into malicious systems optimized for fraud, toxicity, and misinformation.

One approach involves fine-tuning an existing LLM on tailored datasets to specialize it for abusive purposes. Another technique is prompt engineering - carefully crafting prompts to "jailbreak" an LLM's safety controls and output harmful text. Manipulating contexts and examples guide the LLM to produce toxic, biased, or deceptive outputs while posing as a friendly chatbot.

Downloading open-source LLMs that lack safety measures and running them locally without restrictions is another avenue for misuse. For example, using GPT-Neo under one's control opens the door to unchecked harm. These techniques can transform outwardly benign LLMs into Trojan systems optimized for abuse.

Let's explore the state of malicious LLMs.

### WormGPT

Derived from the GPT-J model created in 2021 by EleutherAI, [WormGPT](https://slashnext.com/blog/wormgpt-the-generative-ai-tool-cybercriminals-are-using-to-launch-business-email-compromise-attacks/) has gained attention in cybercrime. Distinct from the legitimate ChatGPT, WormGPT has found its niche in darknet forums, promoted as a tool for automating fraud. Its primary function is the automation of creating personalized emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

SlashNext, a leading cybersecurity firm, extensively analyzed WormGPT to evaluate its potential risks. Their studies focused on its use in Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. There's speculation that WormGPT's training data leaned heavily on malware-centric content, but specific datasets remain undisclosed.

WormGPT is [available for purchase](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/wormgpt-and-fraudgpt-the-rise-of-malicious-llms/) on hacker forums. The developer offers a WormGPT v2 version for €550 annually and a premium build priced at €5000, encompassing WormGPT v2 and other advanced features.
