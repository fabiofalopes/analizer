* LLMs are being used for various tasks, including research into satellite and radar technologies, generic research aimed at supporting cyber operations, and assistance with coding, scripting, and troubleshooting.
* Threat actors are using LLMs to generate content, including phishing emails, and to evade detection by security systems.
* LLMs are being used to support social engineering, including generating translations and communication, and to refine operational command techniques.
* Threat actors are using LLMs to gather actionable intelligence on technologies and potential vulnerabilities, and to develop methods that help malicious activities blend in with normal behavior or traffic to evade detection systems.

## META

* The research was conducted in collaboration with OpenAI and involves the analysis of identified activity associated with known threat actors, including prompt-injections, attempted misuse of large language models (LLMs), and fraud.
* The research was conducted using Microsoft Threat Intelligence, which tracks more than 300 unique threat actors, including 160 nation-state actors, 50 ransomware groups, and many others.
* The research was conducted using the MITRE ATT&CK framework and MITRE ATLAS knowledgebase to track and classify the TTPs used by threat actors.
