**SUMMARY**
Flutter tutorial on creating a dynamic state in a controller by Portuguese speaker, discussing stateful widgets and updating the UI.

**IDEAS**
* In Flutter, state is essential for dynamic applications.
* Stateful widgets are necessary for updating the UI when the state changes.
* The `setState` function is used to notify the widget that the state has changed.
* Without `setState`, the UI will not update even if the state changes.
* Stateful widgets have a `State` class that holds the state of the widget.
* The `build` method is called every time the state changes.
* Using `setState` ensures that the UI is rebuilt with the new state.
* Stateful widgets are necessary for interactive applications.
* The `StatefulWidget` class is used to create stateful widgets.
* The `State` class is used to hold the state of the widget.
* The `build` method is used to build the UI of the widget.

**INSIGHTS**
* State is a crucial concept in Flutter for creating dynamic applications.
* Stateful widgets are necessary for updating the UI when the state changes.
* The `setState` function is essential for notifying the widget that the state has changed.
