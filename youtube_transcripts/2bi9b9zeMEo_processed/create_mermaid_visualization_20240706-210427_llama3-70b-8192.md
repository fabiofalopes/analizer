VISUAL EXPLANATION:
This visualization shows the architecture of the Lord of Drinks app, which consists of several components. The CharactersRepository injects an HttpClient, which makes a GET request to the One API Dev. The One API Dev returns a JSON response, which is parsed by the HttpClient and converted into a CharactersList. The CharactersList is then used to update the UI on the CharactersPage.

The One API Dev component is broken down into its API, Endpoints, and CharactersEndpoint. The API returns a JSON response, which is obtained through the CharactersEndpoint.

The HTTP Client component is broken down into its GetMethod, URL, and Headers. The GetMethod takes a URL and Headers as input.

The Characters Page component is broken down into its CharactersList and Character components. The CharactersList contains a list of Characters, each of which has a Name and ID.

This visualization highlights the key components and relationships between them in the Lord of Drinks app.
