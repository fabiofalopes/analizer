Here is the output in the required format:

**FLOW**

* Introduction to the Lord of Drinks app
* Improving the app's architecture
* Injecting dependencies using Provider
* Creating a HTTP client to make API requests
* Using the HTTP client to fetch characters from the API
* Processing the JSON response
* Creating a Character class to hold the data
* Using the Character class to display the data

**DESIRED TAKEAWAY**

The final takeaway is to understand how to create a well-structured app that makes API requests and processes the response data using a HTTP client and a Character class.

**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction

* Title: "Lord of Drinks App"
* Bullet points:
	+ Improving the app's architecture
	+ Injecting dependencies using Provider
	+ Creating a HTTP client to make API requests
	+ Using the HTTP client to fetch characters from the API
	+ Processing the JSON response
	+ Creating a Character class to hold the data
* Image description: A screenshot of the Lord of Drinks app
* Speaker notes: "Welcome to the Lord of Drinks app. Today, we're going to improve its architecture and make API requests to fetch characters."

### Slide 2: Improving the App's Architecture

* Title: "Improving the App's Architecture"
* Bullet points:
	+ Using Provider to inject dependencies
	+ Creating a HTTP client to make API requests
* Image description: A diagram of the app's architecture
* Speaker notes: "To improve the app's architecture, we're going to use Provider to inject dependencies and create a HTTP client to make API requests."

### Slide 3: Creating a HTTP Client

* Title: "Creating a HTTP Client"
* Bullet points:
	+ Using the `http` package to make API requests
	+ Creating a `HttpClient` class to encapsulate the API requests
* Image description: A code snippet of the `HttpClient` class
* Speaker notes: "To create a HTTP client, we're going to use the `http` package and create a `HttpClient` class to encapsulate the API requests."

### Slide 4: Making API Requests

* Title: "Making API Requests"
* Bullet points:
	+ Using the `HttpClient` class to make API requests
	+ Fetching characters from the API
* Image description: A code snippet of making an API request
* Speaker notes: "Now, let's use the `HttpClient` class to make API requests and fetch characters from the API."

### Slide 5: Processing the JSON Response

* Title: "Processing the JSON Response"
* Bullet points:
	+ Using the `jsonDecode` function to parse the JSON response
	+ Creating a `Character` class to hold the data
* Image description: A code snippet of processing the JSON response
* Speaker notes: "Once we receive the API response, we need to process the JSON data using the `jsonDecode` function and create a `Character` class to hold the data."

### Slide 6: Creating a Character Class

* Title: "Creating a Character Class"
* Bullet points:
	+ Creating a `Character` class to hold the data
	+ Using the `Character` class to display the data
* Image description: A code snippet of the `Character` class
* Speaker notes: "Now, let's create a `Character` class to hold the data and use it to display the characters in the app."

### Slide 7: Conclusion

* Title: "Conclusion"
* Bullet points:
	+ We improved the app's architecture
	+ We created a HTTP client to make API requests
	+ We processed the JSON response and created a `Character` class
* Image description: A screenshot of the Lord of Drinks app
* Speaker notes: "That's it! We improved the app's architecture, created a HTTP client to make API requests, processed the JSON response, and created a `Character` class to hold the data. Thank you for watching!"
