**VISUAL EXPLANATION**

* The diagram shows the different approaches to mobile application development using HTML5.
* HTML5 uses responsiveness, which involves various techniques such as fluid grid, flexible images, and media queries.
* Media queries define CSS rules for different screen sizes.
* Dynamic serving is an alternative approach that uses server-side detection of device type to send tailored HTML.
* Another alternative is to use separate URLs for mobile and desktop versions of a website, where the user selects the device type.
* Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the specific use case.
