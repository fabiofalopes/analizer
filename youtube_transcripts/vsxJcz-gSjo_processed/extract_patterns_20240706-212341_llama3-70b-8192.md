Here is the output in Markdown format:

**PATTERNS**
* Implementing offline mode by creating a repository class that abstracts the data source
* Using a connectivity service to check if the app is online or offline
* Creating a local database to store data when offline
* Implementing a repository class that extends an abstract class and implements the logic for online and offline modes
* Using dependency injection to provide the repository class with the necessary dependencies
* Creating a provider to inject the repository class into the app
* Using the repository class to get data from the API or local database depending on the connectivity status
* Implementing a system to synchronize data between the API and local database
* Using asynchronous functions to perform database operations in the background
* Implementing a system to cache data locally to improve performance

**META**
* The idea of implementing offline mode was mentioned multiple times in the input
* The concept of a repository class was introduced to abstract the data source
* The connectivity service was mentioned as a way to check if the app is online or offline
* The local database was introduced as a way to store data when offline
* The repository class was implemented to extend an abstract class and implement the logic for online and offline modes
* Dependency injection was used to provide the repository class with the necessary dependencies
* The provider was created to inject the repository class into the app
* The repository class was used to get data from the API or local database depending on the connectivity status
* The system to synchronize data between the API and local database was implemented
* Asynchronous functions were used to perform database operations in the background
* The system to cache data locally was implemented to improve performance

**ANALYSIS**
The input describes the implementation of offline mode in an app, using a repository class to abstract the data source and a connectivity service to check if the app is online or offline.

**BEST 5**
* Implementing offline mode using a repository class
* Using a connectivity service to check if the app is online or offline
* Creating a local database to store data when offline
* Implementing a system to synchronize data between the API and local database
* Using asynchronous functions to perform database operations in the background

**ADVICE FOR BUILDERS**
* Use a repository class to abstract the data source and implement offline mode
* Implement a connectivity service to check if the app is online or offline
* Create a local database to store data when offline
* Implement a system to synchronize data between the API and local database
* Use asynchronous functions to perform database operations in the background
