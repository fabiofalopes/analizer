**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
Implementing offline mode in an application using a repository pattern to switch between local and remote data sources based on connectivity.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. Create an abstract class with functions for API operations and local database operations.
2. Implement a repository class that extends the abstract class and handles logic for local and remote data sources.
3. Use a connectivity service to determine whether to use local or remote data sources.
4. Implement offline mode by storing data from API in local database when online.
5. Use the repository class to switch between local and remote data sources based on connectivity.
6. Test the implementation by switching between online and offline modes.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

1. The repository pattern allows for easy switching between local and remote data sources.
2. Implementing offline mode requires storing data from API in local database when online.
3. A connectivity service is necessary to determine whether to use local or remote data sources.
4. The implementation allows for easy testing of online and offline modes.
5. The repository class provides a single point of interaction with the data sources, making it easy to manage data retrieval and storage.
