**SUMMARY**
This video tutorial shows how to implement navigation between multiple pages in a Flutter application using a Bottom navigation bar.

**IDEAS**
* Implement navigation between multiple pages in a Flutter application
* Use a Bottom navigation bar to switch between pages
* Create a Main page that manages the navigation bar
* Use a list of tuples to represent the information of each page

* Use the `setState` function to refresh the UI when the selected index changes

**INSIGHTS**
* The Main page is responsible for managing the navigation bar and switching between pages
* The `map` function can be used to transform a list of tuples into a list of navigation destinations
* A stateful widget is necessary to handle the selected index and refresh the UI
