**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction

* Title: Navigation in Flutter
* Bullet points:
	+ Implementing navigation between multiple pages
	+ Using a Bottom navigation bar
* Image description: A screenshot of a Flutter app with a Bottom navigation bar
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Welcome to this presentation on navigation in Flutter. Today, we'll be covering how to implement navigation between multiple pages using a Bottom navigation bar."

### Slide 2: Diagram Explanation

* Title: How Navigation Works
* Bullet points:
	+ Main page with Bottom navigation bar
	+ Pages (Page 1, Page 2) with AppBars and icons
	+ Navigation between pages
* Image description: A diagram showing the navigation flow between pages
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Let's take a look at how navigation works in Flutter. We have a Main page with a Bottom navigation bar, and multiple pages that can be navigated to."

### Slide 3: Creating the Main Page

* Title: Creating the Main Page
* Bullet points:
	+ Creating a Scaffold with a Bottom navigation bar
	+ Using a list of tuples to store page information
* Image description: A screenshot of the Main page code
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, let's create the Main page. We'll use a Scaffold with a Bottom navigation bar, and store our page information in a list of tuples."

### Slide 4: Creating Pages

* Title: Creating Pages
* Bullet points:
	+ Creating Page 1 and Page 2 with AppBars and icons
	+ Using the list of tuples to create NavigationDestinations
* Image description: A screenshot of the Page 1 and Page 2 code
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Next, we'll create our pages. We'll create Page 1 and Page 2 with AppBars and icons, and use our list of tuples to create NavigationDestinations."

### Slide 5: Implementing Navigation

* Title: Implementing Navigation
* Bullet points:
	+ Using the NavigationDestination list to create the Bottom navigation bar
	+ Handling page changes on navigation bar clicks
* Image description: A screenshot of the navigation implementation code
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, let's implement navigation. We'll use our NavigationDestination list to create the Bottom navigation bar, and handle page changes on navigation bar clicks."

### Slide 6: Converting to Stateful Widget

* Title: Converting to Stateful Widget
* Bullet points:
	+ Converting the Main page to a Stateful widget
	+ Using setState to refresh the UI on page changes
* Image description: A screenshot of the Stateful widget code
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Finally, we need to convert our Main page to a Stateful widget, and use setState to refresh the UI on page changes."

### Slide 7: Conclusion

* Title: Conclusion
* Bullet points:
	+ Implemented navigation between multiple pages
	+ Used a Bottom navigation bar
	+ Converted the Main page to a Stateful widget
* Image description: A screenshot of the final app
* Speaker notes:
	+ "And that's it! We've implemented navigation between multiple pages using a Bottom navigation bar, and converted our Main page to a Stateful widget. Thank you for watching!"
