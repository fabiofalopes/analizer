**Introduction to the Observer-Observable Pattern**

In this video, I will introduce the observer-observable pattern and demonstrate how it can improve our air conditioner controller. Specifically, I will separate the graphical interface from the business logic, which is a crucial aspect of software development. Although this pattern might seem excessive for this simple application, it is essential for preparing the application for future enhancements, such as making requests to a server, utilizing a database, or incorporating sensors, which can benefit from this pattern.

**The Observer-Observable Pattern Explained**

The observer-observable pattern consists of an object, the observable, which is observed by one or more objects, the observers. The observable has a set of variables, referred to as its state, and a set of observers interested in changes to this state. When the state changes, the observable notifies the observers. To achieve this, the observers must register with the observable, and the observable must notify them whenever a variable changes.

**Advantages of the Observer-Observable Pattern**

One of the primary advantages of this pattern is that it allows for a clear separation of responsibilities. The observable does not know what the observers will do with the state changes; it simply notifies them. This separation enables multiple observers to observe the same observable, which can be beneficial in various scenarios.

**Applying the Observer-Observable Pattern in Flutter**

In Flutter, this pattern is implemented using classes with slightly different names. Instead of observer and observable, we have consumer and ChangeNotifier. The principle remains the same, with the ChangeNotifier being the observable and the consumer being the observer. In our example, we have a controller AC, which is the ChangeNotifier, and a variable temperature that we want to notify the consumers about.

**Implementing the Observer-Observable Pattern**

To implement this pattern, we need to make the controller AC a ChangeNotifier and register the consumer, which is the graphical interface, as an observer. We can do this by using the `ChangeNotifierProvider` instead of the regular `Provider`. This allows the object returned by the provider to be a ChangeNotifier. Then, in the `build` method, we can use the `watch` method to observe the changes to the controller AC.

**Benefits of the Observer-Observable Pattern**

By using this pattern, we can simplify our code and improve the separation of concerns between the graphical interface and the business logic. We no longer need to use `setState` to refresh the interface, as the observer will automatically be notified of changes to the observable.

**Improving Unit Tests**

To better understand the observer-observable pattern, we can improve our unit tests. We can register as an observer of the controller AC and verify that the observer is notified when the temperature changes. This allows us to test the observer-observable pattern in isolation, without the need for an emulator.
