**PATTERNS**
* Observer pattern allows for separation of responsibilities between observable and observer.
* Observable object doesn't know what observers will do with its state changes.
* Observer pattern enables multiple observers to observe the same observable.
* Observer pattern is useful for applications that require real-time updates.
* In Flutter, the observer pattern is implemented using ChangeNotifier and Consumer.
* ChangeNotifier is the observable and Consumer is the observer.
* notifyListeners is used to notify observers of state changes.
* Observer pattern simplifies code and improves separation of concerns.
* Observer pattern is useful for testing unit tests.

**META**
* The observer pattern is used to separate the interface from the business logic.
* The observable object is responsible for notifying observers of state changes.
* Observers register themselves with the observable object.
* The observer pattern is useful for applications that require real-time updates.
* The observer pattern is implemented using ChangeNotifier and Consumer in Flutter.
* The notifyListeners method is used to notify observers of state changes.

**ANALYSIS**
The observer pattern is a useful design pattern that allows for separation of responsibilities between observable and observer, enabling real-time updates and simplifying code.

**BEST 5**
* The observer pattern allows for separation of responsibilities between observable and observer.
* The observer pattern enables multiple observers to observe the same observable.
* The observer pattern is useful for applications that require real-time updates.
* The observer pattern simplifies code and improves separation of concerns.
* The observer pattern is useful for testing unit tests.

**ADVICE FOR BUILDERS**
* Use the observer pattern to separate the interface from the business logic.
* Use ChangeNotifier and Consumer in Flutter to implement the observer pattern.
* Register observers with the observable object to receive state changes.
* Use notifyListeners to notify observers of state changes.
* Test unit tests using the observer pattern.
