Here is the output in the required format:

**FLOW**

* Introduce the Observer Observable pattern
* Explain the benefits of using this pattern
* Apply the pattern to a simple AC controller example
* Show how to separate the interface from the business logic
* Implement the pattern in Flutter using ChangeNotifier
* Register the controller as an observer
* Notify the observers when the state changes
* Update the UI automatically when the state changes
* Simplify the code by removing the need for setState
* Improve the separation of concerns between the UI and business logic
* Write unit tests to verify the functionality

**DESIRED TAKEAWAY**

The Observer Observable pattern allows for a clear separation of responsibilities between the UI and business logic, making it easier to maintain and test the code.

**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction
* Title: Observer Observable Pattern
* Bullets:
	+ Introduce the pattern
	+ Explain the benefits
* Image description: A simple diagram showing the observer and observable objects
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Welcome to this video where we'll explore the Observer Observable pattern"
	+ "This pattern is useful for separating concerns between the UI and business logic"

### Slide 2: Benefits
* Title: Benefits of the Pattern
* Bullets:
	+ Multiple observers can observe the same observable
	+ Clear separation of responsibilities
* Image description: A diagram showing multiple observers observing the same observable
* Speaker notes:
	+ "One of the main benefits of this pattern is that multiple observers can observe the same observable"
	+ "This leads to a clear separation of responsibilities between the UI and business logic"

### Slide 3: AC Controller Example
* Title: Simple AC Controller Example
* Bullets:
	+ Temperature variable
	+ Observers want to be notified of changes
* Image description: A simple diagram showing the AC controller and observers
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Let's consider a simple example of an AC controller"
	+ "The temperature variable is the state that we want to observe"

### Slide 4: Implementing the Pattern
* Title: Implementing the Pattern in Flutter
* Bullets:
	+ Use ChangeNotifier
	+ Register the controller as an observer
* Image description: A diagram showing the ChangeNotifier and observer registration
* Speaker notes:
	+ "In Flutter, we can implement the pattern using ChangeNotifier"
	+ "We register the controller as an observer to receive notifications"

### Slide 5: Notifying Observers
* Title: Notifying Observers
* Bullets:
	+ Notify observers when the state changes
	+ Use notifyListeners
* Image description: A diagram showing the notifyListeners method
* Speaker notes:
	+ "When the state changes, we notify the observers using notifyListeners"
	+ "This method is called whenever the state changes"

### Slide 6: Updating the UI
* Title: Updating the UI
* Bullets:
	+ The UI is updated automatically when the state changes
	+ No need for setState
* Image description: A diagram showing the UI updating automatically
* Speaker notes:
	+ "The UI is updated automatically when the state changes"
	+ "We don't need to use setState anymore"

### Slide 7: Separation of Concerns
* Title: Separation of Concerns
* Bullets:
	+ Clear separation between UI and business logic
	+ Easier to maintain and test
* Image description: A diagram showing the separation of concerns
* Speaker notes:
	+ "The Observer Observable pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns between the UI and business logic"
	+ "This makes it easier to maintain and test the code"

### Slide 8: Unit Tests
* Title: Unit Tests
* Bullets:
	+ Write unit tests to verify the functionality
	+ Use the pattern to improve testability
* Image description: A diagram showing unit tests
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We can write unit tests to verify the functionality of the code"
	+ "The Observer Observable pattern makes it easier to write unit tests"
