**SUMMARY**
The speaker is preparing the World of Rings app for offline mode, ensuring that users can still access character information even without connectivity. The speaker fixes an error and adds a new function to obtain character data from the database.

**IDEAS:**

* Preparing an app for offline mode
* Fixing an error in the app
* Adding a new function to obtain character data from the database
* Using a logging tool to diagnose issues
* Creating a class to handle character data
* Implementing a repository pattern for data storage
* Using an abstract class to define the interface for data storage
* Creating separate classes for network and database storage
* Using a source parameter to determine where to retrieve data from
* Creating a delete function to remove characters from the database
* Using a Future void to execute a delete operation
* Creating a button to delete all characters
* Improving the app's architecture for offline mode
* Creating an interface for character repository
* Implementing the interface for network and database storage
* Using the interface to determine where to retrieve data from
