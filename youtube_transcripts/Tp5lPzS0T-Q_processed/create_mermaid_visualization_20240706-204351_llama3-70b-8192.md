Here is the Mermaid syntax visualization for the input:

```mermaid
graph LR
    classDef blackWhite fill:#000,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
    classDef blackWhiteText fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:2px

    subgraph Application
        direction LR
        class Application blackWhite
        class Controller blackWhite
        class View blackWhite
        class Model blackWhite

        Application --> Controller
        Controller --> View
        Controller --> Model
    end

    subgraph Controller
        direction LR
        class ACController blackWhite
        class Temperature blackWhite
        class Increase blackWhite
        class Decrease blackWhite

        ACController --> Temperature
        Temperature --> Increase
        Temperature --> Decrease
    end

    subgraph Model
        direction LR
        class Temperature blackWhite
        class MaxTemperature blackWhite

        Temperature --> MaxTemperature
    end

    subgraph Tests
        direction LR
        class ControllerTest blackWhite
        class IncreaseTest blackWhite
        class DecreaseTest blackWhite

        ControllerTest --> IncreaseTest
        ControllerTest --> DecreaseTest
    end

    VISUAL EXPLANATION
    * Application has a Controller
    * Controller has a Temperature and methods to Increase and Decrease
    * Temperature has a MaxTemperature limit
    * Tests are run on the Controller
    * Increase and Decrease tests are run separately
    * Application is decoupled from the Controller and View
    * Controller is isolated from the View and Model
    * Model has a Temperature with a MaxTemperature limit
    * Tests are run on the Controller to ensure it works correctly
```
