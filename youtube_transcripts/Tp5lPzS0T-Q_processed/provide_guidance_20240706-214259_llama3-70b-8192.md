ONE SENTENCE ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATION
Separate the business logic from the graphical interface to improve code organization and testability.

ANALYSIS
* The code is mixing business logic with graphical interface logic.
* The temperature variable should be isolated in a separate class.
* The control logic is tightly coupled with the graphical interface.
* The code is not following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
* The business logic is not easily testable due to its coupling with the graphical interface.
* The code is using a "god object" approach, where one class is responsible for multiple, unrelated tasks.
* The temperature variable is not encapsulated, making it prone to errors.
* The code is not following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
* The business logic is not decoupled from the presentation layer.
* The code is not using dependency injection to manage dependencies.

RECOMMENDATIONS
* Create a separate class for the business logic (e.g., ControladorAC).
* Isolate the temperature variable in the new class.
* Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between classes.
* Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to separate concerns.
* Use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate presentation and business logic.

ESTHER'S ADVICE
* "Separate the wheat from the chaff" - isolate the business logic from the graphical interface.
* "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" - separate concerns to improve code organization.
* "Testability is key" - make sure the business logic is easily testable.

SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS
* What are the benefits of separating business logic from graphical interface?
* How can I improve code organization and testability?
* What are the consequences of not following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?
* How can I apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to my code?

POSSIBLE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS
* Code smell: God Object
* Code smell: Tight Coupling
* Code smell: Long Method
* Code smell: Switch Statements with Many Cases

SUMMARY
Separate the business logic from the graphical interface to improve code organization and testability, and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to write more maintainable and scalable code.
