Here is the refined text in academic and scientific language:

"In this video, we will improve our controller by isolating the business logic from the graphical interface. Currently, our controller is functioning perfectly, reacting to these buttons and updating automatically. However, we have identified that the state of the application is being managed within the widget itself, which is not ideal. Ideally, we would like to separate this behavior into a distinct class, for instance, a controller AC class, which would have a temperature variable and methods to increase and decrease the temperature.

Let's create a new file and define this controller AC class, which will have a temperature variable and a constructor. We will also add methods to increase and decrease the temperature, with a boolean return value indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

Now that we have this class, we can refactor our original controller to use this new class. We will initialize the controller AC class through a constructor, and then use its methods to increase and decrease the temperature.

By isolating the business logic in a separate class, we gain several benefits. Firstly, it becomes easier to add validations, limitations, and constraints that should not be mixed with the graphical interface logic. For example, we can add a maximum temperature limit of 40 degrees, beyond which the temperature cannot be increased. We can also return a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful or not, and use this value to display an alert to the user.

Furthermore, we can easily test this class using unit tests, which is not possible with graphical interface classes that are difficult to test. We can create a test class, for instance, controlador a ser teste, and write test methods to verify the behavior of the controller AC class.

In this test class, we can create a test method to verify that the temperature is correctly initialized, and another test method to verify that the temperature does not increase beyond the maximum limit. We can run these tests to ensure that the controller AC class is functioning correctly.

By separating the business logic from the graphical interface, we have achieved a better design for our application. The logic of the application is now isolated, and we can easily test and maintain it."
