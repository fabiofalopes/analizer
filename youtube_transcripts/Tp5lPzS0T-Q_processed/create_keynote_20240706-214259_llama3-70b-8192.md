* Image description: A screenshot of the current application
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Welcome to this video where we'll improve our controller."
	+ "Currently, our application is working perfectly, but there's room for improvement."

### Slide 2: Current State
* Title: Current State of the Application
* Main content:
	+ Application is working perfectly
	+ But there's room for improvement
* Image description: A screenshot of the current application
* Speaker notes:
	+ "As you can see, our application is working perfectly."
	+ "But we can still improve it by separating the logic and interface."

### Slide 3: Need for Improvement
* Title: Need for Improvement
* Main content:
	+ Mixing logic and interface is not ideal
	+ Need to separate concerns
* Image description: A diagram showing the mixing of logic and interface
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Currently, we're mixing logic and interface in our application."
	+ "This is not ideal, and we need to separate these concerns."

### Slide 4: Creating a New Class
* Title: Creating a New Class for the Controller
* Main content:
	+ Creating a new class for the controller
	+ Defining properties and methods
* Image description: A code snippet showing the new class
* Speaker notes:
	+ "To improve our application, we'll create a new class for the controller."
	+ "This class will have properties and methods that define its behavior."

### Slide 5: Implementing Logic
* Title: Implementing the Controller's Logic
* Main content:
	+ Implementing the controller's logic
	+ Using a constructor and methods
* Image description: A code snippet showing the implemented logic
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, let's implement the controller's logic."
	+ "We'll use a constructor and methods to define its behavior."

### Slide 6: Integrating with Interface
* Title: Integrating the Controller with the Interface
* Main content:
	+ Integrating the controller with the interface
	+ Using the controller to update the interface
* Image description: A diagram showing the integration
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, let's integrate the controller with the interface."
	+ "We'll use the controller to update the interface."

### Slide 7: Benefits
* Title: Benefits of Separating Logic and Interface
* Main content:
	+ Benefits of separating logic and interface
	+ Easier testing and maintenance
* Image description: A diagram showing the benefits
* Speaker notes:
	+ "By separating logic and interface, we gain several benefits."
	+ "It's easier to test and maintain our application."

### Slide 8: Adding Validations
* Title: Adding Validations and Constraints
* Main content:
	+ Adding validations and constraints
	+ Ensuring the controller's behavior
* Image description: A code snippet showing the added validations
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, let's add some validations and constraints to our controller."
	+ "This will ensure that our controller behaves as expected."

### Slide 9: Testing
* Title: Testing the Controller
* Main content:
	+ Testing the controller
	+ Using unit tests
* Image description: A screenshot of the testing process
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, let's test our controller."
	+ "We'll use unit tests to verify its behavior."

### Slide 10: Conclusion
* Title: Conclusion
* Main content:
	+ Summary of the improvements
	+ Final thoughts
* Image description: A screenshot of the final application
* Speaker notes:
	+ "In conclusion, we've improved our application by separating logic and interface."
	+ "This has led to a more maintainable, testable, and scalable codebase."
