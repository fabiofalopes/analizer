**SUMMARY**
Video about improving a controller, separating logic from graphical interface, and testing with unit tests.

**IDEAS**
* Separate logic from graphical interface for better organization and testing.
* Use classes to isolate specific behaviors and make code more modular.
* Create unit tests to ensure code works as expected.
* Use constructors to initialize objects with specific properties.
* Implement limitations and constraints to prevent unwanted behavior.
* Use boolean returns to indicate success or failure of operations.
* Test code in isolation to ensure it works correctly.
* Use testing frameworks to run multiple tests at once.
* Create multiple tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
* Use testing to ensure code behaves as expected even when modified.
* Separate concerns and responsibilities in code for better maintainability.
* Use abstraction to make code more flexible and reusable.
* Create a clear and organized structure for code.
* Use meaningful names for variables and classes to improve readability.
* Keep code concise and focused on specific tasks.

**INSIGHTS**
* Separating logic from graphical interface improves code organization and testability.
* Modular code is easier to maintain and modify.
* Testing code in isolation ensures it works correctly and catches errors early.
* Implementing limitations and constraints prevents unwanted behavior.
* Abstraction makes code more flexible and reusable.
* Clear and organized code structure improves readability and maintainability.

**QUOTES**
* "Idealmente, o que a gente gostaria era de isolar este comportamento numa classe própria."
* "Nós estamos a gerir o estado da aplicação dentro do próprio widget ou seja estamos a misturar um bocadinho e interface gráfica com aquilo que se chama a lógica de negócio."
* "Eu agora posso fazer uma coisa deste ano e a temperatura é menor que 40."

**HABITS**
* Separate logic from graphical interface when coding.
* Use classes to organize code and make it more modular.
* Write unit tests to ensure code works as expected.
* Use constructors to initialize objects with specific properties.
* Implement limitations and constraints to prevent unwanted behavior.

**FACTS**
