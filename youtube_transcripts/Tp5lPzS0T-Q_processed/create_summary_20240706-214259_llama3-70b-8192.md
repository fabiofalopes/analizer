**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
The video improves the controller by isolating the business logic into a separate class, making it easier to add validations and test.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. The current controller is not ideal, mixing business logic with graphical interface.
2. A new class, `ControladorAC`, is created to isolate the business logic.
3. The `ControladorAC` class has a temperature variable and methods to increase and decrease it.
4. The class is initialized with a constructor and has a `aumenta` method that returns a boolean.
5. The `ControladorAC` class is used in the graphical interface, replacing the previous temperature variable.
6. The new class makes it easier to add validations and limitations to the temperature.
7. Unit tests can be written to test the `ControladorAC` class independently of the graphical interface.
8. A test is created to verify that the temperature does not exceed 40 degrees.
9. The `ControladorAC` class can be tested without simulating clicks on the graphical interface.
10. The video concludes with a well-designed application, separating business logic from graphical interface.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

1. Isolate business logic from graphical interface for better maintainability and testability.
2. Use separate classes to organize code and make it easier to add features and tests.
3. Unit tests can be used to verify the behavior of business logic classes.
4. Validations and limitations can be added to business logic classes to ensure correct behavior.
5. Separating business logic from graphical interface makes it easier to test and maintain the application.
