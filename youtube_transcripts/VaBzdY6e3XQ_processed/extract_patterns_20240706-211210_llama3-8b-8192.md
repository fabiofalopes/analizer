This is a video transcript of a developer explaining how to create a local database using SQLite and a Flutter app. The developer is using the `sqflite` package to interact with the database.

The developer starts by creating a new Flutter project and adding the `sqflite` package to the project. They then create a new database file called `lotr_database.db` and initialize it using the `Database` class from the `sqflite` package.

The developer then creates a new table called `Character` with columns for `id`, `name`, `birth`, `death`, and `gender`. They use the `rawQuery` method to execute a SQL query to create the table.

Next, the developer creates a new class called `LotrDatabase` that extends the `Database` class. This class provides methods for inserting, updating, and deleting data in the `Character` table.

The developer then creates a new widget called `CharacterList` that displays a list of characters from the database. They use the `FutureBuilder` widget to build the list of characters asynchronously.

The developer also creates a new button called `Insert Character` that allows the user to insert a new character into the database. They use the `insert` method from the `LotrDatabase` class to insert the new character.

Finally, the developer shows how to use the `app inspector` to verify that the data has been inserted into the database correctly.
