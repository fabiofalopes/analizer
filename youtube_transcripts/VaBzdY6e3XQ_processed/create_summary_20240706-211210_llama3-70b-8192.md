**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
The video continues to improve the Lord of the Rings app by creating a local database using SQLite and implementing features to insert and retrieve data from the database.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. The app is improved by adding a local database using SQLite.
2. A new package called `sqflite` is used to interact with the database.
3. A `LotrDatabase` class is created to manage the database.
4. The database is initialized asynchronously using a `Future`.
5. A `FutureBuilder` is used to display a circular progress indicator while the database is being initialized.
6. A `getCharacters` function is created to retrieve data from the database.
7. A `fromDB` function is created to convert database data into a `Character` object.
8. A new button is added to insert a character into the database.
9. An `insertCharacter` function is created to insert data into the database.
10. The app is updated to display the inserted data.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

1. SQLite is a suitable choice for a local database in a Flutter app.
2. Asynchronous programming is necessary when interacting with a database.
3. `FutureBuilder` can be used to display a progress indicator while waiting for asynchronous data.
4. Data conversion is necessary when retrieving data from a database.
5. Inserting data into a database requires a separate function.
