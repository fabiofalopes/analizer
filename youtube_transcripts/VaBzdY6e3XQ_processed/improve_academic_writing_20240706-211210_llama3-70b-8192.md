Here is the refined text in academic and scientific language, with improved clarity, coherence, and ease of understanding:

**Identity and Purpose**

In this video, we will continue to improve our Lord of the Rings application by creating a local database. We will add two new buttons: one to retrieve characters from the local database and another to insert new characters.

**Creating a Local Database**

We will use a database called SQLite, which is included in both iOS and Android devices. We will create a new package called `data` and a file called `lotr_database.dart`. Inside this file, we will create a `LotrDatabase` class that uses the SQLite database.

**Initializing the Database**

We will create an `init` method to initialize the database. This method will create the database tables and return a `Future` to indicate when the initialization is complete.

**Using the Database**

We will create a `getCharacters` method that retrieves characters from the database. This method will use the `Database` class to execute a query and return a list of characters.

**Inserting Data into the Database**

We will create an `insertCharacter` method that inserts a new character into the database. This method will take a `Character` object as a parameter and return a `Future` to indicate when the insertion is complete.

**Implementing the User Interface**

We will modify the user interface to include two new buttons: one to retrieve characters from the network and another to retrieve characters from the local database. We will also add a button to insert a new character into the database.

**Testing the Application**

We will test the application to ensure that the local database is working correctly. We will insert a new character into the database and then retrieve the characters from the database to verify that the data is being stored correctly.

**Changes Made**

* Created a local database using SQLite
* Added two new buttons to the user interface: one to retrieve characters from the local database and another to insert new characters
* Implemented the `getCharacters` method to retrieve characters from the database
* Implemented the `insertCharacter` method to insert new characters into the database
* Modified the user interface to include the new buttons and functionality

Note: I made some minor changes to the text to improve clarity and coherence, but I did not change the overall meaning or content of the text.
