**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
Separate navigation state from presentation logic using the observer-observable pattern and dependency injection.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. Extract navigation state into a separate class, `MainPageViewModel`.
2. Use the observer-observable pattern to notify listeners of state changes.
3. Implement the `ChangeNotifier` class to notify listeners.
4. Use the `Provider` class to inject dependencies into the `MainPage` widget.
5. Create a `MainPageViewModel` instance and inject it into the `MainPage` widget.
6. Use the `watch` method to refresh the `MainPage` widget when the state changes.
7. Implement a button to navigate to page one using the `MainPageViewModel` instance.
8. Use dependency injection to access the `MainPageViewModel` instance in the button's `onPressed` method.
9. Update the `selectedIndex` property of the `MainPageViewModel` instance to navigate to page one.
10. The observer-observable pattern and dependency injection simplify future maintenance and development.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

1. Separate navigation state from presentation logic for easier maintenance and development.
2. Use the observer-observable pattern to notify listeners of state changes.
3. Implement dependency injection to access and update state instances.
4. Use the `Provider` class to inject dependencies into widgets.
5. The observer-observable pattern and dependency injection simplify complex application logic.
