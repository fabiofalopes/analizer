**SUMMARY**
Separating navigation state from presentation using the Observer pattern in Flutter.

**IDEAS**
* Separate navigation state from presentation using the Observer pattern.
* Use a View Model to represent the navigation state.
* Implement the Observer pattern using the ChangeNotifier in Flutter.
* Use the Provider to inject the View Model into the widget tree.
* Use the Watch method to refresh the widget when the View Model changes.
* Isolate the navigation state to make it easier to implement new features.
* Use dependency injection to access the View Model.
* Use the Observer pattern to notify widgets of changes to the View Model.

**INSIGHTS**
* Separating navigation state from presentation makes it easier to maintain and extend the application.
* The Observer pattern allows for loose coupling between widgets and the View Model.
* Dependency injection makes it easy to access the View Model from any widget.
* Isolating the navigation state makes it easier to implement new features.

**QUOTES**
* "When we extract information that has to do with the presentation logic, we normally call it a View Model."
* "The Model is the classes that represent the business logic, and the View Model is the classes that represent the presentation logic."
* "When we develop our applications in this way, future maintenance is greatly facilitated."

**HABITS**
* Separate navigation state from presentation using the Observer pattern.
* Use a View Model to represent the navigation state.
* Implement the Observer pattern using the ChangeNotifier in Flutter.
* Use the Provider to inject the View Model into the widget tree.

**FACTS**
* The Observer pattern is used to notify widgets of changes to the View Model.
* The ChangeNotifier is used to implement the Observer pattern in Flutter.
* The Provider is used to inject the View Model into the widget tree.

**REFERENCES**
* Flutter
* ChangeNotifier
* Provider

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
