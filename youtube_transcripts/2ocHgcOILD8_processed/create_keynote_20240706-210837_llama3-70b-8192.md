**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction

* Title: Handling Asynchronous API Calls in Flutter
* Bullet points:
	+ Importance of handling errors and loading states
	+ Introduction to `Future` and `FutureBuilder` classes
* Image description: A diagram showing the different states of a `Future` (e.g. waiting, completed, error)

### Slide 2: The Problem

* Title: The Problem of Handling Asynchronous API Calls
* Bullet points:
	+ Making API calls can take time
	+ Need to handle loading and error states
	+ Need to update the UI accordingly
* Image description: A screenshot of a Flutter app with a loading indicator

### Slide 3: FutureBuilder

* Title: Introducing FutureBuilder
* Bullet points:
	+ A widget that builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with a `Future`
	+ Can be used to handle asynchronous API calls
	+ Can handle loading and error states
* Image description: A diagram showing how `FutureBuilder` works

### Slide 4: Using FutureBuilder

* Title: Using FutureBuilder to Handle Asynchronous API Calls
* Code snippet:
```dart
FutureBuilder(
  future: _fetchData(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.hasData) {
      return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}');
    } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
    } else {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    }
  },
)
```

### Slide 5: initState

* Title: Using initState to Make API Calls Only Once
* Code snippet:
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _fetchData();
}
```
* Image description: A diagram showing how `initState` works

### Slide 6: Future

* Title: Understanding Futures
* Bullet points:
	+ A class that represents the result of an asynchronous operation
	+ Can be used to handle asynchronous API calls
	+ Can be used with `then` and `whenComplete` to handle the result
* Image description: A diagram showing how `Future` works

### Slide 7: then and whenComplete

* Title: Using then and whenComplete to Handle the Result of a Future
* Code snippet:
```dart
_fetchData().then((data) {
  print('Data: $data');
}).whenComplete(() {
  print('Completed');
});
```
* Image description: A diagram showing how `then` and `whenComplete` work

### Slide 8: Conclusion

* Title: Conclusion
* Bullet points:
	+ Learned how to handle asynchronous API calls in a Flutter app using `FutureBuilder` and `initState`
	+ Learned how to use `Future` to handle asynchronous operations
	+ Learned how to use `then` and `whenComplete` to handle the result of a `Future`
