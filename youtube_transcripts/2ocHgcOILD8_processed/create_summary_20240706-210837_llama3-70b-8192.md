**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
The video discusses how to handle asynchronous API calls in a Flutter application using the FutureBuilder widget.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. The video continues developing a Lord of the Rings application, focusing on implementing a character detail page.
2. The application uses a repository to make API calls to a server, which returns a list of characters.
3. The video explains how to use the FutureBuilder widget to handle asynchronous API calls.
4. The FutureBuilder widget takes a Future as a parameter and returns a widget based on the state of the Future.
5. The video demonstrates how to use the FutureBuilder widget to display a circular progress indicator while waiting for the API call to complete.
6. The video also explains how to handle errors that may occur during the API call.
7. The video discusses the importance of treating the three possible cases: waiting, success, and error.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

1. Use the FutureBuilder widget to handle asynchronous API calls in Flutter.
2. Treat the three possible cases: waiting, success, and error.
3. Use the ConnectionState property of the AsyncSnapshot to determine the state of the Future.
4. Use the data property of the AsyncSnapshot to access the data returned by the API call.
5. Use the error property of the AsyncSnapshot to access any errors that may have occurred during the API call.
