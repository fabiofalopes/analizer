**Modifying the Widget to Display Dynamic Time**

In our previous application, we successfully implemented a controller to change the temperature. However, the time remained static. In this video, we will explore how to modify the widget to display the current time dynamically.

To achieve this, we will create a method called `buildCurrentTimeWidget`. This method will convert the time into a dynamic format. We will also create a variable `now` to facilitate the process.

Next, we will use a `Timer` class from Dart to update the time every second. We will initialize the timer in the `initState` method, which is called only once when the widget is created and added to the screen. This is an ideal place to initialize the timer.

To test the timer, we will create a `print` statement to display the current time every second. We will also ensure that the timer is cancelled when the widget is disposed to prevent memory leaks.

Now, we want to refresh the widget every second without affecting the entire controller state. To achieve this, we will create a separate widget for the current time and extract the timer logic into this widget. This will allow us to isolate the refreshment of this specific widget without affecting other widgets.

By doing so, we can avoid unnecessary rebuilds of other widgets, which can improve the performance of our application. This is a common problem in architecture, where we want to isolate the refreshment of specific widgets to prevent performance issues.
