Here is the output based on the input provided:

**FLOW**

* Introduction to the problem of static time display
* Extracting the build hour function to a separate method
* Converting the function to a block function for simplicity
* Creating a variable to store the current time
* Using a timer to update the time every second
* Initializing the timer in the init state
* Canceling the timer in the dispose method
* Using the timer to refresh the widget
* Isolating the refreshment of the widget to avoid affecting other widgets
* Extracting the widget to its own file
* Creating a new widget that controls its own state and refreshment
* Converting the code to use the new widget
* Testing the new widget

**DESIRED TAKEAWAY**

The desired takeaway is that by isolating the refreshment of a specific widget, we can avoid affecting other widgets and improve the performance of the application.

**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction
* Title: Dynamic Time Display
* Bullet points:
	+ Static time display is a problem
	+ We need to update the time every second
* Image description: A clock with a static time display
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Welcome to our presentation on dynamic time display. We're going to show you how to update the time every second."

### Slide 2: Extracting the build hour function
* Title: Extracting the build hour function
* Bullet points:
	+ Extracting the function to a separate method
	+ Converting the function to a block function
* Image description: A code snippet showing the extracted function
* Speaker notes:
	+ "First, we need to extract the build hour function to a separate method. This will make it easier to manage and update."

### Slide 3: Creating a variable to store the current time
* Title: Creating a variable to store the current time
* Bullet points:
	+ Creating a variable to store the current time
	+ Using the variable to display the current time
* Image description: A code snippet showing the variable declaration
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Next, we need to create a variable to store the current time. This will allow us to update the time every second."

### Slide 4: Using a timer to update the time
* Title: Using a timer to update the time
* Bullet points:
	+ Using a timer to update the time every second
	+ Initializing the timer in the init state
* Image description: A code snippet showing the timer initialization
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, we need to use a timer to update the time every second. We'll initialize the timer in the init state."

### Slide 5: Canceling the timer
* Title: Canceling the timer
* Bullet points:
	+ Canceling the timer in the dispose method
	+ Avoiding memory leaks
* Image description: A code snippet showing the timer cancellation
* Speaker notes:
	+ "It's also important to cancel the timer when we're done with it. This will avoid memory leaks and improve performance."

### Slide 6: Isolating the refreshment of the widget
* Title: Isolating the refreshment of the widget
* Bullet points:
	+ Isolating the refreshment of the widget to avoid affecting other widgets
	+ Creating a new widget that controls its own state and refreshment
* Image description: A diagram showing the isolated widget
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, we need to isolate the refreshment of the widget to avoid affecting other widgets. We'll create a new widget that controls its own state and refreshment."

### Slide 7: Creating a new widget
* Title: Creating a new widget
* Bullet points:
	+ Creating a new widget that controls its own state and refreshment
	+ Using the new widget to display the current time
* Image description: A code snippet showing the new widget
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Here's an example of the new widget. It controls its own state and refreshment, and displays the current time."

### Slide 8: Conclusion
* Title: Conclusion
* Bullet points:
	+ We've isolated the refreshment of the widget
	+ We've improved the performance of the application
* Image description: A clock with a dynamic time display
* Speaker notes:
	+ "In conclusion, we've successfully isolated the refreshment of the widget and improved the performance of the application. Thank you for watching!"
