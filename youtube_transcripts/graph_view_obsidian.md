ï»¿Breath view, it looks pretty cool. AtÂ  the beginning, I didn't really know theÂ Â  power of graph views. So today, we're talkingÂ  about how to use graph view in Obsidian. Â  Alright, graph view. There are two types of graphÂ  views. The first one is the one that you see now,Â Â  this is the global graph view, and there's alsoÂ  a local graph view. Today, I want to start withÂ Â  local first because, actually, especiallyÂ  when you're just starting with Obsidian,Â Â  local graph view can be so much moreÂ  powerful. So let's get to it. Â  Okay, let's open up a note. Say, "PhilosophyÂ  is like jazz." This is a very simple note;Â Â  we've got a couple of links and we've got aÂ  tag. So let's open up local graph view to seeÂ Â  what we can get out of this. Right now, it's not that useful,Â Â  right? It literally mirrors the note here thatÂ  you have, the note itself, and then the threeÂ Â  notes that we're linking to in the note, so notÂ  very interesting. But if you open up filtersÂ Â  here out of the four optionsâfilters, groups,Â  display, and forcesâif you focus on filtersÂ Â  for local graph review, it will give you aÂ  lot more power. So let's take a look. Â  First, and the most important, is depth. TheÂ  slider right here is set to one right now,Â Â  which means that we're only going one levelÂ  in depth, which is why there is the main noteÂ Â  and all of the notes that we're linkingÂ  to. So that's the first level of depth.Â Â  But you can increase this, and as you increase,Â Â  more notes that are linked to the notes thatÂ  you're linking to will start to pop up. Â  So, the deeper you go, the more notes thatÂ  are going to show up, and I'll share withÂ Â  you a few use cases for depth in a moment. ButÂ  just as a function, depth is very important.Â Â  And then there are a few other toggles thatÂ  can be helpful depending on how you set upÂ Â  your Obsidian. So right now, we have incoming andÂ  outgoing links toggled on, so we'll see both linksÂ Â  coming into "Philosophies Like Jazz" and linksÂ  going out of "Philosophy is Like Jazz." Â  Then you can also add neighboring links, whichÂ  will give you more, even more notes that will showÂ Â  up as you toggle the depth, as well as you canÂ  have tags show up as well. So depending on how youÂ Â  set up your tags, this could also be very useful.Â  And then you can have attachments show as well,Â Â  if you've got PDFs and images and those things,Â  and you can also toggle on and off for existingÂ Â  files only. If you don't know what that means,Â  at the very simple sense, there are two typesÂ Â  of files that exist in Obsidian. One is existingÂ  files, which means it looks like a note like this;Â Â  there is a body to the note, not just a title,Â  whereas if it's a non-existing file like theseÂ Â  ones that are a bit grayed out, I haven'tÂ  actually created the note, I just have aÂ Â  placeholder with the title of the note, there'sÂ  actually nothing in the note itself, and so thatÂ Â  is a non-existing node. So I can toggle that onÂ  and off. And if I just come back to level one,Â Â  that's probably easier to see. If I toggle existing files only on,Â Â  there will only be one link because theseÂ  two links here are non-existing files. Okay,Â Â  hopefully, I haven't confused you. This isÂ  not really a super important point. Â  But here's local graph view, and now let me shareÂ  with you the two use cases for local graph viewÂ Â  that are so powerful. Use case 1 - CreateÂ  a new note and change how I take my notes.Â Â  Use case number one for local graphÂ  view is when you start a new note.Â Â  So there is no excuse to say, "Oh, IÂ  haven't, you know, started anything,Â Â  so I don't use the graph." You can use it when youÂ  start a new note, and let me show you how. Â  So I am reading this book, "The Order of Time" byÂ  Carlo Rovelli. I love all his books, and in here,Â Â  he has an interesting thing I want to take notesÂ  on, which is on rebellion. "Rebellion is perhapsÂ Â  among the deepest roots of science, the refusal toÂ  accept the present order of things." I love thisÂ Â  concept of rebellion. I was the most rebelliousÂ  kid in our family, and so let's see, let's startÂ Â  a note on this. And if you've been around for aÂ  while, you know that when I start a new note, IÂ Â  always do command-O to bring up search for files,Â  and I put the keyword in to see if I've doneÂ Â  something similar, so I can already put my mindÂ  into this connective thinking mode. And I wrote,Â Â  "Philosophers are the OG Rebels." Interesting . Well, okay, that's good to know. Â  Let's start a new note first. So this one we'llÂ  call "RebellionâDo I spell it right? RebellionÂ Â  with two L's?âRebellion is as the root ofÂ  science." Okay, let's start this new note. Let meÂ Â  just add the bibliography. This is Carlo Rovelli,Â  "The Order of Time." Okay, and the context is,Â Â  "Refusal to accept the presentÂ  order of things equals rebellion."Â Â  Oops, why can't I spell "Rebellion equals theÂ  beginning of how science began?" Okay. Â  Okay, now if we want to start linking to ideas weÂ  already know, when we searched the files, this isÂ Â  perhaps related to the idea that philosophers areÂ  the OG Rebels, right? There's a both a rebellious,Â Â  which is interesting because philosophy physics isÂ  basically philosophy, and philosophy is very muchÂ Â  related to physics, so that makes a lot of senseÂ  to me. But let's see, even if I didn't have that,Â Â  okay, let me even if I remove this, let'sÂ  see what will happen if we just increaseÂ Â  the depth of our local graph view. The mystery of time, sometimes playwrightsÂ Â  are more philosophical than philosophers.Â  Interesting, so already we are seeingÂ Â  a philosophy come up, right? The two are related,Â  two opposing ideas at the same time, creativity.Â Â  I wonder what the connection is there,Â  thinking is not a linear process,Â Â  which I really like because thinking is notÂ  a linear process. Okay, so let's say related,Â Â  thinking is not a linear process. Okay, what thisÂ  means is that rebellion is not a linear path,Â Â  for example, right? We don't just follow someoneÂ  else's path forward; we try to explore a littleÂ Â  bit as rebels, so that's interesting. Okay, let's see,Â Â  reality is not what it seems. I think that'sÂ  also a really interesting idea becauseÂ Â  thinking in that sense, science, youÂ  know, very established, serious subject,Â Â  is actually rebellious at heart, right? We thinkÂ  of science as the source of truth, very objective,Â Â  very logical, but it's not just objective; it'sÂ  rooted in emotions. Okay, also very interesting,Â Â  and you know, now we're seeing, okay, there'sÂ  not a linear path, there's emotion in this veryÂ Â  objective and logical, seemingly logical field,Â  right? This is interesting; it's kind of likeÂ Â  a paradox, which is, of course, related to howÂ  can I hold two opposing ideas at the same timeÂ Â  and function. Okay, uh, let's keep exploring ourÂ  ideas and see if we can get anything else. Oh,Â Â  okay, here we go, here is theÂ  philosophers are the OG Rebels. Â  Eventually, we end up there, even if we don'tÂ  search, uh, so let's bring that into this.Â Â  Philosophers are the OG Rebels, and we know thatÂ  physics is science. I think I actually have aÂ Â  note on this. Let's see if I have a physics isÂ  for, okay, I literally have a note called "TheÂ Â  Physics is Philosophy." Okay, so now it all makesÂ  sense, right? Like philosophers are the OG Rebels,Â Â  not satisfied with the status quo, scientists,Â  same thing, and so this connection between physicsÂ Â  and philosophy is just so tight, and okay, likeÂ  this note is starting to make sense, you know,Â Â  it's a new idea, but very quickly, we can seeÂ  how it latches onto the ideas we already haveÂ Â  in our vault. So that's the first powerful usageÂ  of local graph view when we make a new note. Â  Use case 2 - Process notes. Alright, there isÂ  a use case number two for local graph view,Â Â  and it is when we process our notes when we thinkÂ  through, let's say, we took a bunch of literatureÂ Â  notes and fleeting notes, now we want to get toÂ  the permanent note level where we are thinkingÂ Â  through the ideas and generating our own insights.Â  This is actually a great place to use a localÂ Â  graph view as well, and so I'll just take the sameÂ  example since we've already been working on this,Â Â  and let's say now that I've come back andÂ  I want to write a newsletter about this,Â Â  how can I, you know, figure somethingÂ  out and process these ideas. Â  So first, we already went through, okay,Â  some of our discovery was that, you know,Â Â  rebellion is crucial to both science andÂ  philosophy. Philosophy and science are actuallyÂ Â  kind of the same things. Okay, interesting,Â  uh, where can we take this idea? So let's goÂ Â  back to our graph view, and let's just exploreÂ  a little bit, see if anything jumps out. Â  For example, here, uh, concepts are arbitrary.Â  Okay, interesting, right? Like we say I amÂ Â  studying physics, and so I'm a scientist,Â  versus I'm saying, okay, I'm a philosopher,Â Â  right? I my head is in the cloud, and I think tooÂ  much, or whatever the stereotype is. So perhaps weÂ Â  can use this idea to demonstrate that concepts are arbitrary, and let me justÂ Â  take a look at what are some of the notes I'veÂ  written about under concepts of arbitrary. Â  So, Placebo and side effects, scope switching,Â  okay, I'm looking for deep structuralÂ Â  similarities, not superficial similarities.Â  I really like this idea, um, looking for deepÂ Â  structural similarities, and let's see whereÂ  that leads us to. Okay, outliers, the book,Â Â  trouble creates intelligence, again, this idea ofÂ Â  the mismatch between concepts andÂ  reality, right? It's like, okay,Â Â  science is very logical, but it stems fromÂ  something very emotional, rebellion, you know,Â Â  it, refusal to accept some things. Okay, hereÂ  we're talking about, you know, trouble createsÂ Â  intelligence. Actually, it's not, yeah, justÂ  studying that makes us smart; it is when we meet,Â Â  you know, problems, and we have to solve thoseÂ  that help us train for stuff like this. Okay,Â Â  um, that's very interesting. Let's see if I haveÂ  any notes connected to this. How do we learn?Â Â  Okay, interesting, you know, so now I can takeÂ  this idea of rebellion as the root of science,Â Â  linking into how do we learn becauseÂ  actually, you know, self-directed learning,Â Â  we talk about this like how come some kids areÂ  self-directed, others don't, right? Maybe itÂ Â  stems from this emotional reaction to reality,Â  right? Like if you're not happy with peopleÂ Â  just telling you, well, it is the way it is, soÂ  just, you know, study it, then perhaps you'reÂ Â  more likely to learn in a self-directed way. Anyway, I'm not going to go further on this evenÂ Â  though I'm really excited about this, I'm probablyÂ  write something on this, uh, so let me just,Â Â  I'll quickly write this down. So what I can doÂ  is then come into this note, what I did was pressÂ Â  command and click the link, and it will create aÂ  new link, and I realize I spell thinking wrong,Â Â  um, and I will link to what was it, how we learn,Â Â  and also what else did I link to, um, areÂ  arbitrary, concepts are arbitrary, okay,Â Â  I give myself enough hints so that I can continueÂ  down this rabbit hole because when we, I come hereÂ Â  and I give it, you know, almost like a filter forÂ  which ideas are related, whoops, filter for whichÂ Â  ideas are related if I bring back down the depths,Â  I can focus again, right? So here we, instead ofÂ Â  a view on the previous page which I had to goÂ  to level depth like level four or five to seeÂ Â  these ideas, now if I start here, then I'm able toÂ  focus on these ideas more clearly, right? And goÂ Â  further because now as I increase the depth, I'llÂ  get all sorts of other notes, um, that we didn'tÂ Â  see in the previous, uh, local view, things likeÂ  selection criteria, the Matthew principle. Â  As you can see, I'm super excited aboutÂ  local view, and just very quickly,Â Â  it takes us down very interesting paths andÂ  help us make connections. Global graph view.Â Â  Okay, now global graph view, this is what youÂ  usually see YouTubers show with something thatÂ Â  looks like this, and as you'll see, it's still theÂ  same four things that we can do with this graph,Â Â  so filters, groups, display, and forces in theÂ  local graph, we already talked about filtersÂ Â  except it looks a little bit different fromÂ  this. So what you can do here is filter outÂ Â  more things like if you click on it, you can seeÂ  you can filter things by path, files, tags, lines,Â Â  and sections, uh, and if you want to filterÂ  by something, let's say a tag that says build,Â Â  it'll give you all of the notes for that specificÂ  tag. You can also do minus in front, and thatÂ Â  means exclude anything with the tag build, so nowÂ  I get the rest of my vault, excluding the build,Â Â  and you can choose to display your tags on thisÂ  view or not depending on how you're using it.Â Â  It'll show up in a different color, same withÂ  attachments. I have quite a few images in myÂ Â  notes, so if I untoggle it, it will disappear,Â  and then existing files only, we talked about thisÂ Â  last time, so you can toggle on and off for thatÂ  as well as orphan notes, so you can toggle off andÂ Â  on to see orphan notes. A lot of mine are actuallyÂ  the images, attachments, and I actually talkedÂ Â  about how you can look at all of your orphanÂ  nodes, so you make sure that you are latching yourÂ Â  new ideas onto something that sometimes you justÂ  take very quick notes, we don't actually spendÂ Â  time linking into something else, so it's goodÂ  to refresh, and I talked about it in this video,Â Â  so check that out after this video. And that's basically filters, very easy,Â Â  you can play around with that. Then there areÂ  groups, so this is trying to group, uh, Â  your view with different colors. SoÂ  for example, if I want all my tags thatÂ Â  have the hashtag YT to be red, then you'llÂ  start to see them, uh, then display. So again,Â Â  this is also very visual, so you can see youÂ  can choose to have arrows pointing to differentÂ Â  notes. So now you'll see this, this if we clickÂ  thinking duality, we see that what is this,Â Â  this morning Brew note is pointing to thinkingÂ  in dualities and then this thinking duality isÂ Â  pointing to vice and virtue. So that's arrows,Â  you can have text fade threshold which meansÂ Â  when does the text disappear. The higher theÂ  number, the longer they remain faded, so youÂ Â  really have to zoom in to get them, and then weÂ  have node size, so these are all the circles,Â Â  or lower personal preference as wellÂ  as line thickness, very intuitive,Â Â  and here's the button to animate, which bringsÂ  me to the first use case is honestly global view,Â Â  it just feels good to see that ideas in my headÂ  are visually presented to me, and I can watchÂ Â  them grow over time like that's kind of insane,Â  and that's my favorite use case for global viewÂ Â  is just a little so self-satisfaction,Â  otherwise, you can also play with forces,Â Â  so this is just how much gravity, um,Â  does the note have towards something,Â Â  so if it's Center Force then it condenses allÂ  the nodes to the center, so you don't haveÂ Â  much space in the middle, there's also repelÂ  force so how much each note repels each other,Â Â  the bigger it is, you'll get a bigger graph,Â  more space in the middle, the smaller it is,Â Â  the tighter the circle is going to be, linkÂ  force same here, so if two things are linked,Â Â  it will be closer together, if you bring up theÂ  link force, uh, personally I find it easier toÂ Â  have a higher link force so you can see how yourÂ  ideas cluster and length distance is just how farÂ Â  away they are from each other, so the closer theyÂ  are, you'll be able to see the cluster more clear,Â Â  again use cases, the first one I already told you,Â  satisfaction, the second one is, as you build aÂ Â  over time, you'll be able to see clustersÂ  of your ideas and they'll grow in size,Â Â  so the nodes that have more, more ideasÂ  connected to it will grow over time,Â Â  the more notes you have, the moreÂ  you're going to get out of graph view,Â Â  so check out this video for how to take atomicÂ  notes, and I will see you in the next video. Bye.
