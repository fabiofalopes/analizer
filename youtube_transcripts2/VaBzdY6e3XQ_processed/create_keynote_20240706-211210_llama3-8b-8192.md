Based on the provided video, I will create a presentation outline and a slide deck in Markdown format.

**FLOW**

1. Introduction to Lord of the Rings database
2. Creating a local database using SQLite
3. Creating a provider for the database
4. Using the provider to retrieve data from the database
5. Creating a button to insert data into the database
6. Using the provider to insert data into the database
7. Verifying the data in the database using the App Inspector

**DESIRED TAKEAWAY**

The desired takeaway from this presentation is to demonstrate how to create a local database using SQLite and use a provider to interact with the database in a Flutter application.
