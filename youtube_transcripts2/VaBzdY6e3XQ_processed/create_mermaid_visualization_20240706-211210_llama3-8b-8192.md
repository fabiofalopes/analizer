Here is the Mermaid syntax visualization of the input:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Character] -->|ID|> B[Database]
    B -->|Create|> C[Table]
    C -->|Character|> D[Attributes]
    D -->|Name|> E[String]
    D -->|Gender|> F[Integer]
    F -->|1|> G[Male]
    F -->|0|> H[Female]
    I[Random] -->|NextInt|> J[Integer]
    J -->|0-100|> K[Aleatory ID]
    L[Insert] -->|Character|> M[Database]
    M -->|Insert|> N[Table]
    O[Get Characters] -->|From Database|> P[List of Characters]
    Q[Get Characters] -->|From Network|> R[List of Characters]
    S[Button] -->|Press|> T[State]
    T -->|True|> U[Get Characters from Database]
    T -->|False|> V[Get Characters from Network]
    W[Back Button] -->|Press|> X[State]
    X -->|True|> Y[Go Back]
    X -->|False|> Z[Show Characters]
```
