**Preparing the World of Rings for Offline Mode**

In this video, we will begin preparing the World of Rings for offline mode, where we can continue to obtain character information even when we lose connectivity. To achieve this, we will first resolve an error that has been present for some time, which may have gone unnoticed. Before we proceed, let me remind you that we have a button to obtain characters from the API, and we can then obtain detailed information about the characters. 

The error I am referring to occurs when I load the character, and it returns an error. To facilitate diagnosis, I will add a tool that I find very useful, called Priy HTTP Logger. This library allows us to log all HTTP API requests in a simple way, making it easier to identify the problem.

**Identifying the Error**

By using the Priy HTTP Logger, we can see that the error occurs when we try to obtain character information from the API. The problem lies in the fact that we are trying to obtain information about a character that was created in the database using the Insert Character function, but it does not exist in the API. To resolve this error, we need to create a function that allows us to obtain character information from the database.

**Creating a New Function**

We will create a new function that will allow us to obtain character information from the database. This function will take an ID as a parameter and return the corresponding character information. We will use a similar approach to the one used in the repository, but with some modifications to make it more organized.

**Implementing the New Function**

We will implement the new function by adding a query to the database that will return the character information based on the provided ID. We will then use this function to obtain character information in the Character Detail page.

**Testing the New Function**

We will test the new function by loading the Character Detail page and verifying that it returns the correct character information. We will also add a button to delete all characters from the database.

**Refactoring the Architecture**

To prepare the World of Rings for offline mode, we need to refactor the architecture to make it more modular and flexible. We will create an abstract class called ICharactersRepository, which will have four abstract functions: getAllCharacters, getCharacter, insertCharacter, and deleteCharacter. We will then create two concrete classes, LotrServices and LotrDatabase, which will implement the ICharactersRepository interface.

**Implementing the Concrete Classes**

We will implement the LotrServices class, which will handle API requests, and the LotrDatabase class, which will handle database operations. We will then use these classes to obtain character information in the Character Detail page.

**Conclusion**

In this video, we have prepared the World of Rings for offline mode by resolving an error, creating a new function to obtain character information from the database, and refactoring the architecture to make it more modular and flexible. In the next video, we will show how to use the offline mode with this architecture.
