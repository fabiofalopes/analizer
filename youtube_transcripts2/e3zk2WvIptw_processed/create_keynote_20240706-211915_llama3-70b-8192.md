**FLOW**

* Introduction to preparing World of Rings for offline mode
* Identifying an error in the current implementation
* Adding a logging tool to diagnose the error
* Fixing the error by adding a function to get character data from the database
* Creating a new function to delete all characters from the database
* Modifying the Character detail page to use the new functions
* Creating an abstract class for the characters repository
* Implementing the abstract class for the LotR Services and LotR Database
* Refactoring the code to use the new abstract class
* Testing the implementation

**DESIRED TAKEAWAY**

The desired takeaway is that by using an abstract class for the characters repository, we can easily switch between using the API and the local database for data storage and retrieval, making it possible to prepare the World of Rings app for offline mode.

**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction

* Title: Preparing World of Rings for Offline Mode
* Bullet points:
	+ Identify an error in the current implementation
	+ Fix the error and prepare for offline mode
* Image description: A screenshot of the World of Rings app
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Welcome to our presentation on preparing World of Rings for offline mode."

### Slide 2: Error Identification

* Title: Error Identification
* Bullet points:
	+ Error occurs when trying to get character data
	+ Error is not visible in the log
* Image description: A screenshot of the error message
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We've identified an error in our current implementation."

### Slide 3: Logging Tool

* Title: Adding a Logging Tool
* Bullet points:
	+ Using Priy HTTP Logger to diagnose the error
	+ Logging tool shows HTTP requests and responses
* Image description: A screenshot of the logging tool
* Speaker notes:
	+ "To diagnose the error, we're adding a logging tool."

### Slide 4: Fixing the Error

* Title: Fixing the Error
* Bullet points:
	+ Adding a function to get character data from the database
	+ Function uses a query to retrieve data
* Image description: A screenshot of the new function
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We're fixing the error by adding a new function to get character data from the database."

### Slide 5: Deleting All Characters

* Title: Deleting All Characters
* Bullet points:
	+ Creating a new function to delete all characters from the database
	+ Function uses a raw delete query
* Image description: A screenshot of the new function
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We're also creating a new function to delete all characters from the database."

### Slide 6: Character Detail Page

* Title: Character Detail Page
* Bullet points:
	+ Modifying the Character detail page to use the new functions
	+ Page now uses the database for data storage and retrieval
* Image description: A screenshot of the modified page
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We're modifying the Character detail page to use the new functions."

### Slide 7: Abstract Class

* Title: Abstract Class
* Bullet points:
	+ Creating an abstract class for the characters repository
	+ Class has four abstract functions
* Image description: A screenshot of the abstract class
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We're creating an abstract class for the characters repository."

### Slide 8: Implementation

* Title: Implementation
* Bullet points:
	+ Implementing the abstract class for the LotR Services and LotR Database
	+ Both classes extend the abstract class
* Image description: A screenshot of the implementation
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We're implementing the abstract class for the LotR Services and LotR Database."

### Slide 9: Refactoring

* Title: Refactoring
* Bullet points:
	+ Refactoring the code to use the new abstract class
	+ Code is now more modular and reusable
* Image description: A screenshot of the refactored code
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We're refactoring the code to use the new abstract class."

### Slide 10: Conclusion

* Title: Conclusion
* Bullet points:
	+ We've prepared World of Rings for offline mode
	+ We've used an abstract class for the characters repository
* Image description: A screenshot of the World of Rings app
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We've successfully prepared World of Rings for offline mode using an abstract class for the characters repository."
