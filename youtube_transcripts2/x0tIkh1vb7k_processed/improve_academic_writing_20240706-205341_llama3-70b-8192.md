Here is the refined text in academic and scientific language:

**Series Introduction**

In this video series, I will demonstrate how to implement an application that retrieves all characters from the Lord of the Rings trilogy from a server. This process takes some time for each character, indicating whether they are male or female through an icon. I can click on any character to view their birth and death years, as well as additional information. In this first video, I will not connect to the server yet; instead, I will show how to implement this component using a ListView and navigate to the respective detail page.

**Creating a New Flutter Project**

I have created a new Flutter project, which comes with the default setup. The only thing I have done is add analysis options to prevent warnings at this stage. I will delete the default code and create a new folder called "pages" to store our character list page, which will be a widget.

**Character List Page**

I will create a CharacterListPage widget and import the necessary dependencies. I will start by creating a Scaffold with an AppBar titled "Lord of the Rings" and a body containing a button with the text "Get Characters." The button will be centered, and I will add an onPressed event handler later.

**Character Model**

Before displaying the character list, I need to create objects to store the character information. I will create a "Model" folder and a "Character" file inside it, which will contain a Character class with attributes such as an identifier, birthdate, death date, gender, and name. These attributes are optional, and I will use named constructors to make it easier to create objects.

**Character Repository**

I will create a "Repository" folder and a "CharactersRepository" class, which will have two functions: one to return a list of characters and another to return information about a specific character given their ID. For now, these functions will return fixed information, but later, they will connect to the server.

**Stateful Widget**

I will convert the CharacterListPage to a Stateful widget to update the widget when the button is pressed. I will create a variable to store the character list and update it when the button is pressed.

**ListView**

I will use a ListView to display the character list. I will create a separated ListView with an item count equal to the length of the character list. The item builder will create a ListTile with the character's name, and the separator builder will add a divider between each item.

**Character Detail Page**

I will create a CharacterDetailPage widget that receives a Character ID in its constructor. I will use the CharactersRepository to get the character's information and display it on the page. I will also add a Navigator to push the CharacterDetailPage when an item is tapped on the ListView.

**Conclusion**

In this video, I have demonstrated how to implement a character list page and a character detail page using Flutter. In the next video, I will connect to the server to retrieve the character information.
