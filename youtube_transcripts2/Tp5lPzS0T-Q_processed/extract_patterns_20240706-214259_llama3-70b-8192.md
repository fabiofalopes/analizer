**PATTERNS**
* Separate business logic from graphical interface
* Isolate state management in a separate class
* Use a controller class to manage application state
* Implement temperature limits and constraints
* Test business logic independently of graphical interface
* Use unit tests to verify controller behavior
* Implement validation and limitations in the controller class
* Return a boolean value to indicate success or failure
