**PATTERNS**
* State is a dynamic concept that changes throughout the application.
* Interface graphics must reflect the state changes rapidly.
* Variables are used to store the state of the application.
* Stateful widgets are used when the widget has a state that changes.
* The `setState` function is used to indicate that the state has changed.
* The `setState` function triggers a rebuild of the widget.
* State changes must be wrapped in a `setState` function to be reflected in the interface.
* The `StatefulWidget` class is used to create a widget with a state.
* The `StatefulWidget` class maintains the state of the widget.

**META**
* The concept of state is essential in application development.
* The state is stored in a variable that can be changed dynamically.
* The `setState` function is used to update the state of the widget.
* The `StatefulWidget` class is used to create a widget with a state.
* The `setState` function triggers a rebuild of the widget.
* The state changes must be wrapped in a `setState` function to be reflected in the interface.

**ANALYSIS**
The state of an application is a dynamic concept that changes throughout the application, and the interface graphics must reflect these changes rapidly.

**BEST 5**
* State is a dynamic concept that changes throughout the application.
* Interface graphics must reflect the state changes rapidly.
* The `setState` function is used to indicate that the state has changed.
* Stateful widgets are used when the widget has a state that changes.
* The `StatefulWidget` class is used to create a widget with a state.

**ADVICE FOR BUILDERS**
* Use stateful widgets when the widget has a state that changes.
* Use the `setState` function to indicate that the state has changed.
* Wrap state changes in a `setState` function to reflect changes in the interface.
* Use the `StatefulWidget` class to create a widget with a state.
* Ensure that the state changes are reflected in the interface graphics rapidly.
