**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction to State in Flutter

* Title: State in Flutter
* Bullets:
	+ State is the idea that something is fixed but can change dynamically
	+ State changes in response to user interactions and server messages
* Image description: A simple diagram showing the concept of state
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Welcome to our presentation on state in Flutter. Today, we're going to explore the concept of state and how it's used in Flutter applications."

### Slide 2: Understanding the Concept of State

* Title: What is State?
* Bullets:
	+ State is a variable that changes over time
	+ State is used to update the UI dynamically
* Image description: A simple diagram showing a variable changing over time
* Speaker notes:
	+ "So, what is state? Simply put, state is a variable that changes over time. And in Flutter, we use state to update the UI dynamically."

### Slide 3: Creating a Variable for Temperature

* Title: Creating a Variable for Temperature
* Bullets:
	+ Creating a variable for temperature
	+ Initial value of 25
* Image description: A simple code snippet showing the creation of a variable
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Let's create a variable for temperature. We'll start with an initial value of 25."

### Slide 4: Using the Variable to Update the UI

* Title: Using the Variable to Update the UI
* Bullets:
	+ Using the variable to update the UI
	+ Updating the temperature value
* Image description: A simple code snippet showing the use of the variable
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now, let's use this variable to update the UI. We'll update the temperature value based on user interactions."

### Slide 5: Understanding the Issue with the UI Not Updating

* Title: The Issue with the UI Not Updating
* Bullets:
	+ The UI is not updating despite state changes
	+ The issue is with the type of widget used
* Image description: A simple diagram showing the issue
* Speaker notes:
	+ "But, what happens when we try to update the UI? Unfortunately, the UI doesn't update despite the state changes. And the reason is that we're using the wrong type of widget."

### Slide 6: Introducing Stateful Widgets

* Title: Introducing Stateful Widgets
* Bullets:
	+ Stateful widgets are used for dynamic UI updates
	+ They can be updated when the state changes
* Image description: A simple diagram showing Stateful widgets
* Speaker notes:
	+ "The solution is to use Stateful widgets. These widgets are designed for dynamic UI updates and can be updated when the state changes."

### Slide 7: Converting the Widget to Stateful

* Title: Converting the Widget to Stateful
* Bullets:
	+ Converting the widget to Stateful
	+ Creating a State class
* Image description: A simple code snippet showing the conversion
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Let's convert our widget to Stateful. We'll create a State class and update our widget to use it."

### Slide 8: Understanding the Importance of Notifying the Stateful Widget

* Title: Notifying the Stateful Widget
* Bullets:
	+ Notifying the Stateful widget of state changes
	+ Using the setState function
* Image description: A simple diagram showing the notification process
* Speaker notes:
	+ "But, there's one more thing we need to do. We need to notify the Stateful widget of state changes using the setState function."

### Slide 9: Updating the UI with the New State

* Title: Updating the UI with the New State
* Bullets:
	+ Updating the UI with the new state
	+ The UI is now dynamic
* Image description: A simple diagram showing the updated UI
* Speaker notes:
	+ "And now, when we update the state, the UI updates dynamically. We've successfully created a dynamic UI using Stateful widgets."

### Slide 10: Conclusion

* Title: Conclusion
* Bullets:
	+ Stateful widgets are essential for dynamic UI updates
	+ Notifying the Stateful widget is crucial
* Image description: A simple diagram summarizing the key points
* Speaker notes:
	+ "In conclusion, Stateful widgets are essential for dynamic UI updates in Flutter. And don't forget to notify the Stateful widget of state changes using the setState function. Thank you for watching!"
