**PATTERNS**
* Use FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous API calls
* Implement repository pattern to separate API calls from UI logic
* Use ConnectionState to handle different states of Future (e.g. waiting, done, error)
* Use SnapShot to access data from Future
* Handle errors and exceptions properly
* Use init state to initialize stateful widgets
* Use setState to update UI when data is received
* Avoid unnecessary API calls by using caching or memoization
