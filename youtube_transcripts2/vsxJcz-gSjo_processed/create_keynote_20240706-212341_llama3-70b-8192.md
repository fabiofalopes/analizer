* Speaker notes:
	+ "Welcome to our presentation on implementing offline mode in a mobile app."

### Slide 2: Creating a Repository Class

* Title: "Creating a Repository Class"
* Bullet points:
	+ Abstract class with API functions
	+ Local and remote data sources
	+ Connectivity service to check internet connectivity
* Image description: A diagram of a repository class with local and remote data sources
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We need to create a repository class to handle data storage and retrieval."

### Slide 3: Implementing the Repository Class

* Title: "Implementing the Repository Class"
* Bullet points:
	+ Online mode: retrieve data from API
	+ Offline mode: retrieve data from local storage
	+ Handle insert and delete operations in offline mode
* Image description: A diagram of the repository class implementation
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now let's implement the repository class to handle online and offline modes."

### Slide 4: Creating a Connectivity Service

* Title: "Creating a Connectivity Service"
* Bullet points:
	+ Check internet connectivity
	+ Return true or false based on connectivity status
* Image description: A mobile phone with a Wi-Fi signal strength indicator
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We need to create a connectivity service to check internet connectivity."

### Slide 5: Using the Connectivity Service

* Title: "Using the Connectivity Service"
* Bullet points:
	+ Check connectivity status before retrieving data
	+ Switch between online and offline modes based on connectivity status
* Image description: A diagram of the connectivity service in use
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Now let's use the connectivity service to determine whether to use online or offline mode."

### Slide 6: Handling Insert and Delete Operations

* Title: "Handling Insert and Delete Operations"
* Bullet points:
	+ Online mode: insert and delete data in API
	+ Offline mode: insert and delete data in local storage
* Image description: A diagram of insert and delete operations in online and offline modes
* Speaker notes:
	+ "We need to handle insert and delete operations in offline mode."

### Slide 7: Testing the Offline Mode Implementation

* Title: "Testing the Offline Mode Implementation"
* Bullet points:
	+ Test online mode
	+ Test offline mode
	+ Verify data storage and retrieval
* Image description: A mobile phone with a Wi-Fi signal strength indicator
* Speaker notes:
	+ "Finally, let's test the offline mode implementation to ensure it works as expected."

### Slide 8: Conclusion

* Title: "Conclusion"
* Bullet points:
	+ Implemented offline mode using a repository class and connectivity service
	+ Handled insert and delete operations in offline mode
	+ Tested the offline mode implementation
* Image description: A mobile phone with a Wi-Fi signal strength indicator
* Speaker notes:
	+ "That's it! We've successfully implemented offline mode in our mobile app."
