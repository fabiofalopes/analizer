* Using a `Map` to transform a list of JSON objects to a list of `Character` objects

**META**

* The video demonstrates how to use the Provider package to inject dependencies in a Flutter app.
* The custom HTTP client is used to make API requests to the Lord of the Rings API.
* The `Future` type is used to handle asynchronous operations, such as making API requests.
* The `jsonDecode` function is used to convert JSON data to a Dart object.

**ANALYSIS**

The video provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the Provider package to inject dependencies in a Flutter app. It also demonstrates how to create a custom HTTP client to make API requests and how to use the `Future` type to handle asynchronous operations. The video also shows how to convert JSON data to a Dart object using the `jsonDecode` function and how to create a `Character` class to represent a character from the Lord of the Rings API.

**BEST 5**

1. Using the Provider package to inject dependencies in a Flutter app.
2. Creating a custom HTTP client to make API requests.
3. Using the `Future` type to handle asynchronous operations.
4. Converting JSON data to a Dart object using the `jsonDecode` function.
5. Creating a `Character` class to represent a character from the Lord of the Rings API.

**ADVICE FOR BUILDERS**

* When making API requests, use a custom HTTP client to handle errors and exceptions.
* Use the `Future` type to handle asynchronous operations, such as making API requests.
* Convert JSON data to a Dart object using the `jsonDecode` function.
* Create a `Character` class to represent a character from the Lord of the Rings API.
* Use a `Map` to transform a list of JSON objects to a list of `Character` objects.
