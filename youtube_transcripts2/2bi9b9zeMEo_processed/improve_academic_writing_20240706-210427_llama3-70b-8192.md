Here is the refined text in academic and scientific language:

**Refined Text:**

In this video, we will continue working on the Lord of Drinks application. Currently, the data is fixed, as shown in the previous video. Now, we will connect it to the server to retrieve real-time data from the Lord of Rings API. Before doing so, I want to improve the architecture of this application. 

First, I will inject the dependency using a provider, which we learned about in a previous video. We will start by using the provider to inject the Characters Repository. To do this, we need to go to the pubspec file and add the dependency. 

Next, we will create a class to make HTTP requests to the API. We will create an HTTP client and use it to make GET requests to the server. We will also use a named constructor to pass the HTTP client as a parameter. 

Now, let's create a function to retrieve the characters from the API. We will use the HTTP client to make a GET request to the server and retrieve the response. Since this is an asynchronous operation, we need to use the `async` and `await` keywords to wait for the response. 

Once we receive the response, we need to check the status code to ensure it is 200 OK. If it is, we can process the JSON data and convert it into a list of Character objects. We will create a function to convert the JSON data into a Character object. 

Finally, we will use the `map` function to transform the list of JSON objects into a list of Character objects. We will then return this list as a Future of List<Character>.
