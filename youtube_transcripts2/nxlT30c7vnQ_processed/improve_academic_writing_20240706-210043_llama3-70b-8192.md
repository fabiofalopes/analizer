Here is the refined text in academic and scientific language:

"In this video, we will improve our navigation application by separating the navigation state from the presentation logic using the observer-observable pattern, also known as the Change Notifier, which was introduced in a previous video. This approach will enable us to add a button on page two that allows us to jump directly to page one with ease.

First, I will extract the information that represents the navigation state, which is the current page being displayed, into a separate class called MainPageViewModel. This class is typically referred to as a View Model, as it represents the presentation logic. Note that I am creating a new file for this class, as it has a close relationship with the MainPage, but in a more complex architecture, you may want to extract this class into its own file.

Next, I will pass the selected index to the MainPageViewModel and create getters and setters for it. To make this work correctly, I need to make the View Model observable, so I can observe and be notified when the selected index changes. To achieve this, I will use the observer-observable pattern, which in Flutter is implemented using the Change Notifier.

Now, I will use the Provider to inject the MainPageViewModel into the MainPage. This will allow me to access the MainPageViewModel from any widget within the MyApp or its descendants.

With this approach, I can replace the setState with the View Model's selected index. Note that I am altering the selected index, which will notify all interested parties that the state of the MainPageViewModel has changed. This will trigger a rebuild of the MainPage, ensuring that the navigation state is updated correctly.

To test this, I will add a button on page two that jumps directly to page one when pressed. To achieve this, I will obtain the MainPageViewModel through dependency injection using the Provider and set the selected index to zero. This will notify all observers, including the MainPage, which will update accordingly.

In summary, using dependency injection and the observer-observable pattern may seem excessive for small cases, but it facilitates future maintenance and scalability of our applications. By separating the interface and business logic, we can easily access and alter the state of our application, and notify all interested parties of any changes."
