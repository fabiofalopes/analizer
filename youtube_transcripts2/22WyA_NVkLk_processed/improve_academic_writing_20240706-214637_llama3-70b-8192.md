**Video Script: Integration Testing and Dependency Injection**

In this video, we will continue to improve our air conditioner controller by introducing the concept of integration testing, which is different from unit testing. We will also introduce the concept of dependency injection, a crucial technique for ensuring the independence of our tests.

**Integration Testing**

Integration testing involves simulating actions on an application that is running on a mobile device or emulator. We create a new folder called `integration_test` and a file called `integration_test.dart`. We will use a testing library to write our integration tests.

**Writing the First Test**

Our first test will verify that the temperature displayed on the screen is 25 degrees when the application starts. We use a `tester` object to interact with the widgets and a `finder` to locate the temperature widget. We then use the `tester` to tap on the minus button and verify that the temperature decreases to 24 degrees.

**Dependency Injection**

Our test has a problem: it depends on the initial temperature being 25 degrees. To solve this issue, we will use dependency injection to pass the temperature controller to the `MyApp` widget. This way, we can control the initial temperature in our test.

**Provider**

We will use a provider library to inject the temperature controller into our widgets. We create a `Provider` widget that wraps our `MyApp` widget and passes the temperature controller to it. This way, any widget that needs the temperature controller can access it.

**Benefits of Dependency Injection**

Dependency injection allows us to decouple our widgets from the specific implementation of the temperature controller. This makes our tests more independent and easier to maintain.

**Conclusion**

In this video, we learned how to create integration tests that simulate user interactions with our application. We also learned how to use dependency injection to make our tests more independent and flexible. By using a provider to inject dependencies into our widgets, we can ensure that our tests are robust and reliable.
