**FLOW**

* Introducing integration tests
* Creating a test folder and file
* Understanding the difference between unit tests and integration tests
* Writing the first integration test
* Using the `tester` widget to interact with the app
* Testing the temperature display
* Simulating a button press
* Verifying the temperature update
* Introducing dependency injection
* Creating a provider to manage dependencies
* Passing the controller object through the provider
* Updating the app to use the provider
* Testing the app with different initial temperatures

**DESIRED TAKEAWAY**

The desired takeaway is to understand how to write integration tests for a Flutter app using the `tester` widget and how to use dependency injection to manage dependencies between widgets.

**PRESENTATION**

### Slide 1: Introduction to Integration Tests

* Title: "Integration Tests"
* Bullet points:
	+ Test the app as a whole
	+ Use the `tester` widget to interact with the app
	+ Verify the app's behavior

### Slide 2: Creating a Test Folder and File

* Title: "Creating a Test Folder and File"
* Code snippet:
```dart
integration_test/
integration_test.dart
```

### Slide 3: Understanding Integration Tests

* Title: "Understanding Integration Tests"
* Bullet points:
	+ Different from unit tests
	+ Test the app's UI and behavior
	+ Use the `tester` widget to interact with the app

### Slide 4: Writing the First Integration Test

* Title: "Writing the First Integration Test"
* Code snippet:
```dart
testWidgets('Test temperature display', (tester) async {
  // ...
});
```

### Slide 5: Using the Tester Widget

* Title: "Using the Tester Widget"
* Bullet points:
	+ Interact with the app's UI
	+ Verify the app's behavior
	+ Use the `tester` widget to simulate user interactions

### Slide 6: Testing the Temperature Display

* Title: "Testing the Temperature Display"
* Code snippet:
```dart
final temperatureFinder = find.byKey(Key('temperature'));
expect(temperatureFinder, findsOneWidget);
```

### Slide 7: Simulating a Button Press

* Title: "Simulating a Button Press"
* Code snippet:
```dart
final decrementButtonFinder = find.byKey(Key('decrementButton'));
await tester.tap(decrementButtonFinder);
```

### Slide 8: Verifying the Temperature Update

* Title: "Verifying the Temperature Update"
* Code snippet:
```dart
expect(temperatureFinder, findsOneWidgetWithText('24'));
```

### Slide 9: Introducing Dependency Injection

* Title: "Introducing Dependency Injection"
* Bullet points:
	+ Manage dependencies between widgets
	+ Use a provider to manage dependencies

### Slide 10: Creating a Provider

* Title: "Creating a Provider"
* Code snippet:
```dart
class Provider with ChangeNotifier {
  // ...
}
```

### Slide 11: Passing the Controller Object

* Title: "Passing the Controller Object"
* Code snippet:
```dart
Provider(
  create: (_) => Controller(),
  child: MyApp(),
);
```

### Slide 12: Updating the App to Use the Provider

* Title: "Updating the App to Use the Provider"
* Code snippet:
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final controller = Provider.of<Controller>(context);
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Slide 13: Testing the App with Different Initial Temperatures

* Title: "Testing the App with Different Initial Temperatures"
* Bullet points:
	+ Use the provider to manage dependencies
	+ Test the app with different initial temperatures
	+ Verify the app's behavior
