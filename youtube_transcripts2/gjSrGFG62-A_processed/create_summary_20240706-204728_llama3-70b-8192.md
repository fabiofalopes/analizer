**ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:**
This video tutorial demonstrates how to implement navigation between multiple pages in a Flutter application using a Bottom Navigation Bar.

**MAIN POINTS:**

1. Create a Main Page widget to manage the navigation bar.
2. Define a list of tuples to represent the information of each page.
3. Use a Scaffold widget to create the app bar and body.
4. Implement the Bottom Navigation Bar using the Navigation Bar widget.
5. Use the map function to transform the list of tuples into a list of Navigation Destination objects.
6. Create a Stateful widget to handle the selected index and rebuild the widget when it changes.
7. Use the setState function to refresh the screen and call the build method again.
