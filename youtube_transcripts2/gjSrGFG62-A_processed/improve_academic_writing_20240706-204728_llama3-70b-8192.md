**Implementing Navigation between Multiple Pages in a Flutter Application using a Bottom Navigation Bar**

In this video, I will demonstrate how to implement navigation between multiple pages in a Flutter application using a Bottom Navigation Bar. As you can see, the desired behavior is to have a Main Page that manages the navigation bar, which will change the content in the middle section based on the selected page.

To achieve this, we will create a Main Page widget that will be responsible for creating the navigation bar and ensuring that the content in the middle section changes accordingly. The Main Page will not have a title, and its sole responsibility is to create the navigation bar and switch between different pages.

We will start by creating a pages folder and three widgets: Main Page, Page 1, and Page 2. We will then create a fourth file called pages.dart, which will contain a list of tuples representing the information for each page. Each tuple will have three attributes: title, icon, and widget.

Next, we will create a Scaffold in the Main Page with a Bottom Navigation Bar. We will use the map function to transform the list of tuples into a list of Navigation Destinations, which will be used to populate the Bottom Navigation Bar.

To make the navigation bar functional, we need to create a variable to store the selected index and update it whenever a new page is selected. We will also need to convert the Main Page to a Stateful widget and use the setState function to refresh the UI whenever the selected index changes.

Finally, we will use the selected index to display the correct page in the body of the Main Page. With these changes, the navigation bar should now be fully functional.
