Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs), has resulted in powerful and versatile dual-use systems. This intelligence can be put towards a wide variety of beneficial tasks, yet it can also be used to cause harm. This study explores one such harm by examining how LLMs can be used for spear phishing, a form of cybercrime that involves manipulating targets into divulging sensitive information. I first explore LLMs’ ability to assist with the reconnaissance and message generation stages of a spear phishing attack, where I find that LLMs are capable of assisting with the email generation phase of a spear phishing attack. To explore how LLMs could potentially be harnessed to scale spear phishing campaigns, I then create unique spear phishing messages for over 600 British Members of Parliament using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. My findings provide some evidence that these messages are not only realistic but also cost-effective, with each email costing only a fraction of a cent to generate. Next, I demonstrate how basic prompt engineering can circumvent safeguards installed in LLMs, highlighting the need for further research into robust interventions that can help prevent models from being misused. To further address these evolving risks, I explore two potential solutions: structured access schemes, such as application programming interfaces, and LLM-based defensive systems.

\section{Introduction}
Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the creation of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating human-like text. While LLMs demonstrate impressive technological capabilities that can be harnessed for a wide range of beneficial purposes, their dual-use nature means they can also be used maliciously \cite{brundage2018malicious}.

One noteworthy risk posed by LLMs’ ability to generate coherent text is that these systems could potentially be used to conduct cyber attacks \cite{anderljung2023protecting}. This paper aims to analyse the impacts of integrating LLMs into a number of components of the cyber kill chain, a framework that outlines the various steps cybercriminals must undergo to successfully execute an attack \cite{lockheedmartin}. Specifically, I focus on the practice of spear phishing, a type of cyber attack that involves using personalised information to manipulate targets into revealing sensitive information \cite{caputo2014going}.

First, I demonstrate how LLMs can assist in the reconnaissance phase of a successful spear phishing attack, where cybercriminals gather targets’ personal information to craft effective messaging. Following this, I show how basic prompt engineering \cite{reynolds2021prompt} can bypass safety measures implemented in LLMs, causing them to provide guidance on carrying out spear-phishing attacks. This advice includes examples of how to create basic forms of malicious software, or "malware," and guidelines on the key principles a persuasive spear phishing email should follow. Finally, I conclude by discussing what these results imply for the broader cybersecurity landscape, and what governance interventions might be justified in response to this potential threat.

\section{Social Engineering in Cybercrime}
Social engineering refers to the use of deception and manipulation to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or granting unauthorized access to systems containing such information \cite{jagatic2007social}. Manipulating victims via social engineering is often a critical step of successful cyberattacks, as cybercriminals are able to exploit both technical and social weaknesses. Indeed, social engineering is such an effective tactic because humans are often the most vulnerable components of cybersecurity systems \cite{salahdine2019social}. Due in part to these factors, attacks leveraging social engineering are the most common form of internet crime \cite{fbi2020}.

A popular attack method that relies on social engineering is a phishing attack, which describes when cybercriminals mimic an authentic party to inspire trust and persuade individuals to share passwords, click on malicious links and attachments, or transfer funds \cite{caputo2014going}. A successful phishing attack can be disastrous; for example, in 2014, hackers affiliated with the North Korean government managed to access sensitive data by spear phishing Sony executives \cite{bisson2015sony}, resulting in damages estimated to be between \$70 million and \$100 million \cite{richwine2014cyber}. Another notable example was the breach of a private email account belonging to the chairperson of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, which was the result of a phishing attack carried out by Russian hackers \cite{lipton2016perfect}.

\section{Overview of Large Language Models}
The success of large neural networks has led to significant advances in natural language processing in recent years. State-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3 \cite{brown2020language}, PaLM \cite{chowdhery2022palm}, and GPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4} can generate coherent paragraphs of text, answer detailed questions, reason through complex problems, and write code, among a variety of other natural language tasks.

The tremendous success of LLMs largely stems from utilizing a specific neural network architecture at massive scale, which has led to significant performance gains. These models typically use a transformer architecture that employs attention mechanisms to understand the relationships between words in sentences \cite{vaswani2017attention}. Transformer-based models are capable of learning the intricacies of language through self-supervised training on large datasets. During training, these models are tasked with converting input text into meaningful vector representations and generating output text by predicting the next token in a sequence. Remarkably, the seemingly simple objective of predicting the next token has proven to be an effective foundation for building powerful and versatile AI systems, which exhibit increasingly sophisticated capabilities across a range of tasks.

In recent years, researchers have trained progressively larger models on greater volumes of data with significantly more computational resources, a process known as "scaling" \cite{kaplan2020scaling}. This strategy has fueled a considerable portion of AI progress during this period \cite{sevilla2022compute}. Through scaling, LLMs have been able to tackle a wider variety of tasks with increased proficiency, even without major alterations to the core architecture or training methods.

Scaling LLMs can lead to emergent abilities, wherein large models show unpredictable performance improvements at certain tasks compared to smaller models \cite{wei2022emergent}. This emergent phenomena can result in new risks that existing defense systems are not suited to manage \cite{bommasani2022opportunities}. In particular, OpenAI’s GPT-4 highlighted potential cybersecurity risks, including the model’s improved ability to assist with social engineering compared to earlier LLMs \cite{openai2023gpt4}.

Language models made publicly accessible near the end of 2022, such as GPT-3.5, have ushered in a qualitatively new era for cybercriminals. The relatively crude AI systems of the past often lacked the capabilities needed to significantly enhance hackers’ ability to produce convincing text at scale. These AI systems of the past required expertise, time, and resources to set up, lacked language skills needed to sound realistic, and were not easily generalizable across multiple use-cases. Yet due to the wide proliferation of powerful LLMs, using AI systems to write spear phishing emails is now feasible and inexpensive.

\section{Previous Research on AI and Social Engineering}
While various security researchers have warned about the possibility of AI-augmented cyberattacks \cite{guembe2022emerging}, such discussions have often operated at a high level of abstraction. One example of such warnings is a widely cited report on malicious AI published in 2018, which argued that increasingly capable AI will empower new forms of automated social engineering attacks \cite{brundage2018malicious}. As AI systems grow more capable of modeling genuine human interaction, they could engage in social mimicry that could be difficult even for experts to detect, the authors argued.

The report further warned that malicious actors could use AI to increase both the scale and customizability of mass social engineering campaigns. AI could be used to generate tailored content, such as emails, links, or file attachments, for each individual target at a scale unattainable by human operators. Messages could be generated to mimic a recipient’s friends, colleagues, constituents, or contacts in a distinct style, increasing the likelihood that they will engage with deceptive content.

Progress in language modeling since 2018 has helped substantiate this prediction. Today’s most performant LLMs are capable of assisting with tasks such as identifying and conducting background research on targets, crafting personalized messages, and even designing basic forms of malware.

Even just five years ago, creating AI systems capable of spear phishing demanded significant technical ability and only offered limited performance improvements over traditional tactics. For instance, SNAP\_R, an AI system that employed a clustering algorithm and a long short-term memory neural network to generate targeted phishing tweets \cite{seymour2018generative}, required significant expertise to develop. Although it could only produce basic tweets, a small experiment showed that SNAP\_R generated phishing tweets six times faster than a human with a similar click rate. These results, while modest and likely unscalable, nonetheless highlighted the potential for AI technologies to augment spear phishing campaigns.

Recent advancements in the field of language modeling have since resulted in widely accessible AI systems that can approach (and indeed surpass) human-level performance in numerous natural language tasks, especially when considering scale. These advances have made the kinds of automated social engineering attacks discussed in the 2018 malicious AI report increasingly feasible.

Indeed, these sorts of attacks already appear to be underway. In a whitepaper published in April 2023, researchers at Darktrace observed a 135\% increase in novel social engineering attacks among thousands of active customers between January and February 2023 \cite{darktrace2023generative}. This rise in attacks was attributed by the authors to the widespread adoption of LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT, which has made it easier for cybercriminals to execute sophisticated and convincing social engineering campaigns at scale.

\section{How LLMs Could Be Used for Cyberattacks}
Advanced LLMs are capable of generating human-like language that can be used to create personalized spear phishing messages for as little as cents. Appendix A shows the improved sophistication of the latest LLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic compared to earlier, less powerful models. State-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 show clear improvements over GPT-3 in generating convincing spear phishing attacks that are personalized and human-like.

Moreover, the cost of generating these emails were minimal across all models, and the time required to produce each email was largely trivial. Using Claude, Anthropic’s most capable model, a hacker could generate a batch of 1,000 spear phishing emails for a cost of just \$10 USD, all in under 2 hours.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Process and Examples of Message Creation}
In this section, I will illustrate the process of generating personalized emails for a mass spear phishing campaign by feeding publicly available data on UK Members of Parliament into OpenAI’s API-accessible language models. This demonstration will show how LLMs can improve three key stages of a successful spear phishing campaign: collect, contact, and compromise \cite{bossetta2018weaponization}.

\subsubsection{Collect}
Spear phishing attacks are effective in part due to their personalized nature as tailoring messages significantly increase the likelihood that recipients open and act upon them \cite{bullee2017spear}. As such, the first stage of a spear phishing campaign involves collecting information on the target to increase the likelihood of a successful attack. This process is labor-intensive as conducting background research requires more effort than indiscriminately sending the same message to a large group of targets. Yet due to the relatively low marginal cost of using generative AI models to draft targeted emails, the difference in effort between phishing and spear phishing attacks has narrowed.

The decreased marginal cost of generating a spear phishing email could have significant effects on the global cybersecurity landscape. For example, there is a tactical difference between an attacker who uses scalable attacks and one who uses non-scalable attacks \cite{herley2010plight}. The hacker who opts for a non-scalable attack campaign — which incurs a per-user expense due to the effort required for personalization — must be highly selective when determining who to target. And since distributions of power, value, and wealth tend to follow a power law distribution, the attacker will focus her effort on the most valuable individuals — those at the top of the distribution. Despite these distributions' shape, LLMs could drastically lower the per-user cost of an attack making it economically feasible for cybercriminals to target a wider segment of users with customized attacks rather than only targeting few most desirable targets.

LLMs can help with the collect phase by creating ostensibly genuine messaging using unstructured biographical text about the target as input. In this example, I used GPT-4 to write a simple Python script to scrape Wikipedia pages for every British MP elected in 2019. I then fed this unstructured Wikipedia data into GPT-3.5 asking it to generate biographies for each MP. By generating personalized emails referencing each MP’s region political party personal interests and other details language models can effectively carry out contact phase.

\subsubsection{Contact}
Once background reconnaissance has been conducted next stage is generating attack contacting target with it. Here too generative models assist cybercriminals many state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 trained refuse harmful requests like “generate spear phishing email” due process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) \cite{openai2023gpt4}.

One workaround is asking model suggest features defining successful spear phishing email incorporating those features into beginning prompt set principles assessing GPT-4’s knowledge requested produce set qualitative characteristics describing effective spear phishing email cross-referenced principles found promising existing literature concluded model effectively described various desirable characteristics including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Personalization: Personalizing emails include personal information about recipient including name job title personal interests past work projects increases likelihood email being opened links attachments clicked \cite{burns2019spear}.
    \item Contextual relevance: Making sure email content contextually relevant recipient increases chances acted upon referencing company announcement project recipient involved helps establish sense credibility sender pretending acquaintance colleague dramatically increases likelihood target falling prey spear phishing attack \cite{jagatic2007social}.
    \item Psychology: Human psychology used attacker’s benefit manipulating emotions like fear greed curiosity urgency \cite{hong2012state}.
    \item Authority: Impersonating figure target accountable makes recipients feel more pressured act \cite{ncsc2018phishing}.
\end{itemize}

After determining key ingredients successful spear phishing email gathering personal information intended target next task generating emails at scale combining key principles established target’s biographical details single prompt.

The following examples contain sample emails composed by GPT-4 GPT-3.5 GPT-3 UK Member Parliament while GPT-3.5 rather vague GPT-4 demonstrated greater familiarity personal details minister including previous work history upbringing trade union family language used email generated GPT-4 strongly appeals MP’s values progressive political leanings member Labour Party desire address inequalities.
