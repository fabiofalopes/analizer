**The Rise of AI-Generated Phishing Scams: A Growing Threat to Cybersecurity**

The increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) tools is revolutionizing the phishing landscape, making it more challenging for individuals and organizations to detect and prevent these types of attacks. According to recent research, AI-automated phishing scams are becoming more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous. In fact, studies have shown that 60% of participants fell victim to AI-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts.

The entire phishing process can be automated using large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, which reduces the costs of phishing attacks by more than 95% while achieving equal or greater success rates. Phishing has five distinct phases: collecting targets, collecting information about the targets, creating emails, sending emails, and finally validating and improving the emails. With the ability to generate human-like text and converse coherently, LLMs can be used to automate each phase, making phishing scams more efficient and effective.

There are two types of phishing emails: spear phishing and traditional phishing (sometimes called “spray and pray” phishing). Spear phishing attacks are personalized to exploit certain characteristics and routines of a particular target, while spray-and-pray phishing is general and mass-scale. Spear phishing attacks are expensive, time-consuming, and don’t scale well, as they are individualized for each recipient, but they are highly effective. Thus, attackers can choose between cheap and ineffective or expensive and effective.

To test how AI can change this process, researchers compared emails created using LLMs (automated) with emails created manually using human experts (manual). The results showed that AI-generated phishing emails are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from legitimate emails.

The threat level of phishing scams varies across industries, organizations, and teams. Therefore, it is critical to correctly classify the appropriate risk level to determine what level of phishing protection is required and how much, if anything, should be paid for it. As AI-generated phishing scams continue to increase in quality and quantity, it is essential for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant and invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect themselves from these types of attacks.

According to experts, the use of LLMs to create phishing emails is a game-changer in the world of cybercrime. With the ability to automate the entire phishing process, attackers can launch large-scale phishing campaigns at a fraction of the cost and effort. This raises significant concerns about the potential for AI-generated phishing scams to compromise sensitive information and disrupt business operations.

In conclusion, the rise of AI-generated phishing scams is a growing threat to cybersecurity, and it is essential for individuals and organizations to take proactive measures to protect themselves from these types of attacks. By understanding the mechanisms behind AI-generated phishing scams and investing in robust cybersecurity measures, we can reduce the risk of falling victim to these types of attacks and safeguard our sensitive information.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Phishing Attacks

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the landscape of phishing attacks, making them more sophisticated, personalized, and difficult to detect. Recent research has demonstrated that AI-generated phishing emails can achieve a click-through rate of 37%, surpassing human-generated emails. This is a concerning trend, as AI-enabled phishing attacks can drastically reduce the cost of spear phishing while maintaining or even increasing their success rate.

The use of large language models (LLMs) in phishing attacks has been particularly effective. LLMs can generate highly convincing and personalized emails that exploit psychological biases, making them more likely to be clicked on by unsuspecting victims. In one study, emails generated by LLMs and then edited by human experts received a click-through rate of 62%, outperforming human-generated emails.

The automation of phishing attacks using AI has significant implications for businesses and individuals alike. With the cost of personalized and highly successful phishing attacks reduced to the cost of mass-scale and non-personalized emails, we can expect a vast increase in credible and hyper-personalized spear-phishing emails. This is a concerning trend, as phishing attacks are already costly, and it's about to get much worse.

However, AI can also be used to detect and prevent phishing emails. Recent research has shown that LLMs can be effective in identifying phishing emails and providing recommended actions to the recipient. In one study, four popular LLMs were used to identify phishing emails and provide recommended actions, with some models correctly discovering malicious intentions even in non-obvious phishing emails.

The performance of LLMs in detecting phishing emails varied significantly, with some models performing poorly and failing to detect suspicion even in obvious phishing emails. However, the use of priming queries and chain-of-thought reasoning can improve the accuracy of LLMs in detecting phishing emails.

Business leaders, managers, and security officials must take steps to prepare themselves for the growing concern of AI-enabled spear phishing attacks. This includes understanding the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing, determining the company or division's phishing threat severity level, and confirming current phishing awareness routines.

In conclusion, the impact of AI on phishing attacks is significant, and it's essential to stay ahead of the curve. By understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI in phishing attacks, we can develop more effective strategies to detect and prevent these attacks, and ultimately reduce the risk of falling victim to these sophisticated scams.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Phishing Attacks: A Growing Concern

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of phishing attacks, making them more sophisticated and challenging to detect. The ease of use of LLMs to create deceptive content and mislead users has increased the threat severity of AI-enabled phishing attacks. While AI-enhanced offensive capabilities have yielded significant improvements, the human brain remains a vulnerable target, and organizations must prioritize updating their phishing protection strategies to address this growing concern.

Determining the Phishing Threat Level

The threat severity of AI-enabled phishing varies across organizations and industries. It is crucial to accurately assess the business's risk level and create a cost-benefit analysis to determine the necessary protection measures. This can be achieved internally by forming a dedicated cyber risk team or externally by engaging consultants and subject matter experts. A good starting point is to review industry best practices for phishing awareness training and risk assessment.

Assessing Current Phishing Awareness Routines

After determining the appropriate level of investment in phishing protection, organizations must appraise their current security status. This involves evaluating their phishing awareness routines, including training, reporting, and incident response plans. To facilitate this appraisal, four levels of phishing protection can be considered:

1. No training: The organization does not conduct phishing training, and there is no appointed manager for phishing and/or cybersecurity awareness training, nor routines for reporting phishing attacks or an incident response plan.
2. Basic awareness: Some phishing awareness training is conducted, such as during onboarding, and an appointed person is responsible for phishing-related inquiries. Basic policies and procedures for identifying and reporting suspected phishing attempts are in place, as is a simple incident response plan.
3. Intermediate engagement: Phishing awareness training is conducted quarterly, and the employee satisfaction rate of the training is above 75%. A manager is in charge of the phishing protection strategy. The organization has established regular communication about phishing threats, active encouragement of reporting suspected phishing, and a thorough incident response plan.
4. Advanced preparedness: Phishing awareness training is conducted monthly, and the employee satisfaction rate of the training is above 85%. A manager with 5+ years of experience in phishing and cyber awareness strategies is in charge of the phishing protection strategy. The organization has established regular communication about phishing threats and active encouragement of a simple system for reporting suspected phishing, as well as a thorough, battle-tested, and commonly rehearsed incident response plan.

The Evolution of Phishing Attacks

Artificial intelligence and LLMs are significantly enhancing the severity of phishing attacks, and we can expect a sharp increase in both the quality and quantity of phishing in the years to come. When targeting human users, AI disproportionately benefits attackers by making it easier and more cost-effective to exploit psychological vulnerabilities than to defend and educate users. Most employees have a digital footprint with publicly available information that makes it easy to impersonate them and create tailored attacks. Therefore, phishing is evolving from mere emails to a plethora of hyper-personalized messages, including falsified voice and video.

Conclusion

Managers must correctly classify the threat level of their organization and department to take appropriate action. By raising employee awareness about this emerging threat and equipping them to accurately assess the risk to themselves and their organization, companies can aspire to stay ahead of the curve and mitigate the next generation of phishing attacks, which will claim more victims than ever before.

The Impact of Generative AI and LLMs on Cybersecurity Threats

The increasing use of generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has added a new layer of complexity to the threat landscape, necessitating both common and innovative protection measures to maintain organizations' security posture. These technologies can have a significant impact on the scale of cybersecurity threats, both in terms of the number of attacks and their complexity.

On one hand, generative AI and LLMs can make it easier and faster for attackers to create convincing fake content, leading to an increase in the overall volume of attacks. For instance, an attacker could use an LLM to generate a phishing email that appears to come from a friend or colleague, using their writing style and language to make the email seem more authentic. Additionally, LLMs can be used to generate realistic-looking password guesses, in order to bypass authentication systems.

To mitigate the potential threats posed by generative AI and LLMs, organizations can take immediate steps, such as implementing multi-factor authentication systems, providing training to employees on the increasing threat of highly targeted and personalized phishing attacks, using email filtering systems, and adopting hyperautomation approaches.

Hyperautomation, in particular, can provide an effective defense against phishing attacks that leverage AI technology, by providing organizations with comprehensively-integrated capabilities needed to quickly detect and respond to threats. This can help to reduce the workload on security teams by hyperautomating routine tasks such as incident triage and response.

On the other hand, generative AI and LLMs can also be used by defenders to develop more effective security measures and detect potential threats. For example, security researchers can use LLMs to analyze large volumes of data and identify patterns that could indicate the presence of a cybersecurity threat. Some possible future applications of LLMs in cybersecurity protection include phishing detection, malware detection, threat intelligence analysis, and hyperautomation.

In phishing detection, LLMs can be trained to recognize and flag suspicious emails that may be part of a phishing attack. In malware detection, LLMs can be used to analyze large volumes of code and identify patterns that are associated with malware or other types of cyber attacks. In threat intelligence analysis, LLMs can be used to analyze and categorize large volumes of threat intelligence data, such as security logs or incident reports, to identify patterns and trends in the data that indicate potential threats or vulnerabilities in the system.

By integrating AI-based threat detection capabilities into a hyperautomation platform, organizations can enhance their ability to quickly respond to attacks. For example, machine learning algorithms could analyze network traffic and identify patterns that indicate the presence of a threat, automatically triggering a response, such as blocking the malicious traffic or quarantining an infected device.

In conclusion, the use of generative AI and LLMs is not limited to attackers, and these technologies can also be used by defenders to develop more effective security measures and detect potential threats. By adopting innovative protection measures, such as hyperautomation, organizations can stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape and maintain their security posture.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Cybersecurity: A Growing Concern

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about numerous benefits, but it also poses significant threats to cybersecurity. According to a report by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), AI will make it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine and scam emails, making phishing attacks more sophisticated and challenging to detect.

The NCSC warns that generative AI, which can produce convincing text, voice, and images, will complicate efforts to identify phishing, spoofing, and social engineering attempts. This technology, available through chatbots like ChatGPT, will enable scammers to create highly convincing emails that are almost indistinguishable from genuine ones. As a result, individuals, regardless of their level of cybersecurity understanding, will struggle to assess whether an email or password reset request is genuine or not.

Furthermore, the NCSC predicts that AI will increase the volume of cyber-attacks and heighten their impact over the next two years. Ransomware attacks, which have already affected institutions like the British Library and Royal Mail, are expected to rise, with AI tools helping amateur cybercriminals and hackers to access systems and gather information on targets.

The use of AI in phishing attacks is particularly concerning, as it enables scammers to create fake "lure documents" that are free from translation, spelling, or grammatical errors, making them more convincing to potential victims. Additionally, AI can help sift through and identify targets, making it easier for cybercriminals to launch successful attacks.

However, the NCSC also notes that AI can be used as a defensive tool, detecting attacks and designing more secure systems. The agency encourages businesses to better equip themselves to recover from ransomware attacks, and the UK government has set out new guidelines to promote cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity experts, such as Ciaran Martin, the former head of the NCSC, are calling for stronger action to combat the growing threat of ransomware. Martin argues that unless public and private bodies fundamentally change their approach to ransomware, severe incidents like the British Library attack are likely to occur in the next five years.

In conclusion, the impact of AI on cybersecurity is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is essential to develop effective strategies to mitigate the risks associated with AI-powered phishing and ransomware attacks. By understanding the threats posed by AI, we can work towards creating a more secure cyber environment.

Detecting and Mitigating a Multi-Stage AiTM Phishing and BEC Campaign

A recent attack uncovered by Microsoft Defender Experts highlights the complexity of adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing and business email compromise (BEC) threats. The attack, which originated from a compromised trusted vendor, transitioned into a series of AiTM attacks and follow-on BEC activity spanning multiple organizations. This campaign demonstrates the abuse of trusted relationships between vendors, suppliers, and other partner organizations with the intent of financial fraud.

The attack achieved the end goal of a typical AiTM phishing attack followed by business email compromise, but notable aspects, such as the use of indirect proxy rather than the typical reverse proxy techniques, exemplify the continuous evolution of these threats. The use of indirect proxy in this campaign provided attackers control and flexibility in tailoring the phishing pages to their targets and further their goal of session cookie theft.

After signing in with the stolen cookie through a session replay attack, the threat actors leveraged multifactor authentication (MFA) policies that have not been configured using security best practices in order to update MFA methods without an MFA challenge. A second-stage phishing campaign followed, with more than 16,000 emails sent to the target’s contacts.

This attack highlights the complexity of AiTM attacks and the comprehensive defenses they necessitate. This sophisticated AiTM attack requires beyond the typical remediation measures for identity compromise such as a password reset. Affected organizations need to revoke session cookies and roll back MFA modifications made by the threat actor. The incident also highlights the importance of proactive threat hunting to discover new TTPs on previously known campaigns to surface and remediate these types of threats.

The attackers used an AiTM phishing kit developed, maintained, and operated by a threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1167. This attack demonstrates the use of AiTM with indirect proxy, a type of attack that aims to intercept authentication between users and a legitimate authentication service for the purpose of compromising identities or performing other actions.

In this AiTM attack with indirect proxy method, the attackers presented targets with a website that mimicked the sign-in page of the targeted application, as in traditional phishing attacks, hosted on a cloud service. The said sign-in page contained resources loaded from an attacker-controlled server, which initiated an authentication session with the authentication provider of the target application using the victim’s credentials.

This campaign highlights the importance of comprehensive defenses against AiTM attacks, including proactive threat hunting and remediation measures beyond password resets. It also emphasizes the need for organizations to configure MFA policies using security best practices to prevent attackers from updating MFA methods without an MFA challenge.

AiTM Phishing Attack: A Sophisticated Threat to Cybersecurity

The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the cybersecurity landscape, introducing novel threats that exploit the vulnerabilities of modern technologies. One such threat is the AiTM (Adversary-in-The-Middle) phishing attack, which has been observed to lead to second-stage Business Email Compromise (BEC) activities. This essay delves into the intricacies of an AiTM phishing attack, highlighting its attack chain and the various stages involved in this sophisticated threat.

The AiTM attack begins with a phishing email sent from a trusted vendor, which includes a unique seven-digit code as the subject. This code is likely a tracking mechanism for the attacker, allowing them to monitor the campaign's progress. The email body contains a link to view or download a fax document, which redirects the user to a malicious URL hosted on a legitimate service, such as Canva. This abuse of legitimate services enables the attacker to evade detection and blend in with legitimate email traffic.

Upon clicking the malicious URL, the user is redirected to an intermediary page that displays a fake OneDrive document preview, ultimately leading to an AiTM landing page. This page spoofs a Microsoft sign-in page, requesting the target's password. After the password is provided, the attacker uses the credentials in an authentication session created on the target website. When prompted with Multifactor Authentication (MFA) in the authentication session, the attacker modifies the phishing page into a forged MFA page, requesting a verification code. Once the target completes the MFA, the session token is captured by the attacker.

The phishing pages for the AiTM attack are typically hosted on IP addresses located in Indonesia. The follow-on sign-ins are also observed from the same IP addresses. In the next stage, the attacker uses the stolen session cookie to impersonate the user, circumventing authentication mechanisms of passwords and MFA. This stolen session cookie replay attack allows the attacker to access email conversations and documents hosted in the cloud, generating a new access token to persist longer in the environment.

Finally, the attacker proceeds to add a new MFA method for the target's account, which enables them to maintain persistence and control over the compromised account. This sophisticated attack chain highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, including the implementation of advanced threat protection, regular security awareness training, and the adoption of a zero-trust approach to security.

In conclusion, the AiTM phishing attack is a formidable threat to cybersecurity, leveraging the vulnerabilities of modern technologies to compromise sensitive information. It is essential for organizations to remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts, staying ahead of the evolving threat landscape to protect their assets from sophisticated attacks like AiTM phishing.

**The Evolution of AiTM Attacks: A Case Study on Phishing and BEC Tactics**

The landscape of cyberattacks is rapidly evolving, with attackers continually adapting their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to evade detection and exploit vulnerabilities. A recent case study involving an advanced phishing campaign highlights the increasing sophistication of AiTM (Adversary-in-the-Middle) attacks, which combine phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and impersonification tactics to compromise user credentials and gain unauthorized access to organizations' networks.

**Stage 1: Initial Compromise**

The attack began with a phishing email sent to a user, which successfully compromised their credentials. The attacker then used the stolen credentials to sign in to the user's account, adding a new multi-factor authentication (MFA) method, OneWaySMS, a phone-based OTP service, to the existing MFA method. This allowed the attacker to receive phone-based OTPs, enabling them to sign in undetected.

**Stage 2: MFA Configuration Change**

The attacker added a phone number with an Iranian country code as the number used to receive the phone-based OTP. This change was observed in the cloud application activity logs, highlighting the importance of monitoring MFA configuration changes.

**Stage 3: Inbox Rule Creation**

The attacker created an Inbox rule that moved all incoming emails to the Archive folder and marked them as read. This tactic allowed the attacker to remain undetected while monitoring the user's mailbox.

**Stage 4: Phishing Campaign**

The attacker initiated a large-scale phishing campaign, sending over 16,000 emails with a slightly modified Canva URL to the compromised user's contacts, both within and outside the organization. The emails were sent to recipients identified based on recent email threads in the compromised user's inbox.

**Stage 5: BEC Tactics**

The attacker monitored the victim user's mailbox for undelivered and out-of-office emails, deleting them from the Archive folder. The attacker also responded to recipients who raised questions about the authenticity of the phishing email, falsely confirming its legitimacy.

**Stage 6: Accounts Compromise**

Recipients of the phishing emails who clicked on the malicious URL were also targeted by another AiTM attack. Microsoft Defender Experts identified all compromised users based on the landing IP and sign-in IP patterns.

**Stage 7: Second-Stage BEC**

The attacker initiated another phishing campaign from the mailbox of one of the users compromised by the second AiTM attack. Microsoft revoked the compromised user's session cookie, intervening with the second-stage attack.

**The Importance of Proactive Threat Hunting**

This AiTM attack's use of indirect proxy is an example of the threat's increasingly complex and evolving TTPs to evade and challenge conventional solutions and best practices. Proactively hunting for and quickly responding to threats becomes an even more important aspect in securing organization networks, providing an added layer to other security remediations and helping address areas of defense evasion.

**Microsoft Defender Experts: Extending Security and Threat Defense**

Microsoft Defender Experts is part of Microsoft's global network of over 8,000 security analysts and researchers who help extend organizations' ability to defend their environment, manage security, and augment SOC teams. In this incident, Microsoft Defender Experts actively researched new AiTM and BEC techniques, creating advanced hunting detections for the Defender Experts service. These detections, combined with the experts' own analyses of the anomalous emails and user behavior, enabled them to uncover the attack at its early stages, analyze the entire attack chain, and identify and promptly reach out to affected and targeted customers.

**Rapid Response and Containment**

Defender Experts initiated rapid response with Microsoft 365 Defender to contain the attack, including automatically disrupting the AiTM attack on behalf of the impacted users based on the signals observed in the campaign and initiating zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to find and take automatic remediation actions.

This case study highlights the importance of proactive threat hunting, advanced detection capabilities, and rapid response in combating sophisticated AiTM attacks. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it is essential for organizations to stay ahead of attackers by leveraging the expertise of security professionals and advanced threat defense solutions.
Here is the output in MS Word format:

**The Evasive Nature of AiTM Phishing Attacks and the Importance of Multifaceted Defense**

The recent surge in AiTM phishing attacks has underscored the need for organizations to adopt a comprehensive approach to identity security. These attacks, which involve the theft of session cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA), have proven to be highly evasive and require a multifaceted defense strategy.

**Remediation and Mitigation Efforts**

Defender Experts have worked closely with customers to remediate compromised identities through a series of recommendations, including revoking MFA setting changes made by attackers and requiring re-challenging MFA for MFA updates as the default. However, in the context of AiTM attacks, password reset is not an effective solution, as the attacker can set up persistence methods to sign-in in a controlled manner by tampering with MFA.

**The Importance of MFA and Conditional Access Policies**

While AiTM phishing attempts to circumvent MFA, implementation of MFA remains an essential pillar in identity security and is highly effective at stopping a wide variety of threats. Organizations are advised to work with their identity provider to ensure security controls like MFA are in place. Microsoft customers can implement MFA through various methods, such as using the Microsoft Authenticator, FIDO2 security keys, and certificate-based authentication.

**Complementing MFA with Conditional Access Policies and Advanced Anti-Phishing Solutions**

Defenders can complement MFA with conditional access policies, especially risk-based access policies, to further protect their organizations from such attacks. Additionally, investing in advanced anti-phishing solutions that monitor and scan incoming emails and visited websites can help detect and block malicious activities. Continuous monitoring of suspicious or anomalous activities is also crucial in identifying and mitigating AiTM phishing attacks.

**Leveraging Microsoft 365 Defender and Defender for Cloud Apps**

Microsoft 365 Defender uses its cross-domain visibility to detect malicious activities related to AiTM, such as session cookie theft and attempts to use stolen cookies for signing in. Defender for Cloud Apps connectors raise AiTM-related alerts in multiple scenarios, including attempts by attackers to replay session cookies to access cloud applications. These alerts, combined with data from Defender for Endpoint network protection capabilities, trigger Microsoft 365 Defender alerts on Azure AD environments, enabling organizations to take swift action against AiTM phishing attempts.

In conclusion, AiTM phishing attacks require a multifaceted defense strategy that leverages signals from multiple sources. By implementing MFA, conditional access policies, advanced anti-phishing solutions, and continuous monitoring, organizations can improve their identity security posture and protect themselves from these complex threats.

**The Impact of AI on Cybersecurity: Detecting AiTM Attacks and Ethical Dilemmas**

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the cybersecurity landscape, introducing new threats and challenges. This essay delves into the detection of AiTM (Advanced Interactive Threat Modeling) attacks and explores the ethical dilemmas arising from the increasing autonomy of AI-powered assistants.

**Detecting AiTM Attacks**

AiTM attacks, a type of phishing attack, have become increasingly sophisticated, making them difficult to detect. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, together with Defender for Endpoint, helps detect AiTM attacks on Okta accounts using specific alerts, such as "Possible AiTM phishing attempt in Okta." Other detections that show potentially related activity include email messages containing malicious files, suspicious inbox manipulation rules, and unfamiliar sign-in properties.

**Hunting Queries**

Microsoft Sentinel customers can use analytic templates to find BEC (Business Email Compromise) related activities similar to those described in this post. Additionally, hunting content, such as sign-ins from VPS providers, can be used to perform hunts for BEC-related activities.

**Ethical Dilemmas of AI-Powered Assistants**

A new paper by Google DeepMind researchers highlights the ethical dilemmas arising from the increasing autonomy of AI-powered assistants. These advanced AI agents, which can book flights, manage calendars, and provide information, may ultimately interact with each other, radically altering the nature of work, education, and creative pursuits.

The researchers argue that these agents require limits, as autonomous action comes with more risk of accidents or spreading misinformation. Moreover, as AI agents become more human-like and personalized, they make people vulnerable to inappropriate influence, introducing new issues around trust, privacy, and anthropomorphizing AI.

**Alignment and Values**

The DeepMind researchers propose an updated, four-way concept of alignment for AI agents that considers the AI assistant itself, the user, the developer, and society. An AI assistant is misaligned when it disproportionately favors one of these participants over another. For example, an AI could be misaligned if it pursues its own goals at the expense of the user's well-being.

In conclusion, the impact of AI on cybersecurity is multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive approach to detect AiTM attacks and address the ethical dilemmas arising from the increasing autonomy of AI-powered assistants. By understanding the complexities of AI alignment and values, we can develop more responsible and trustworthy AI systems that benefit society as a whole.
