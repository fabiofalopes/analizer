I apologize, but it seems that the input provided is not a sources folder with various documents containing links. Instead, it appears to be a collection of text descriptions about birds and cars.

To extract links and convert them into APA-style citations, I would need a sources folder with documents containing links. If you could provide that, I would be happy to assist you.

However, if you meant to ask me to extract information from the text descriptions and format them into APA-style citations, I can try to do that. Please let me know what specific information you would like me to extract and format.

For example, if you would like me to extract the descriptions of the birds and cars and format them into APA-style citations, I could try to do that. Here is an example of what the output might look like:

Author, A. A. (Year). Description of the black-billed cuckoo. [Description of the black-billed cuckoo].

Author, B. B. (Year). Description of the Hummer SUV. [Description of the Hummer SUV].

Please let me know if this is what you had in mind, or if there's something else I can assist you with.

---

I apologize, but I don't see any links in the provided text. The text appears to be a collection of descriptions about various topics, including the Hummer SUV and the Black-billed Cuckoo bird. There are no URLs or links present in the text.

If you could provide the actual links or the sources folder containing the links, I would be happy to help you extract the links and convert them into APA-style citations for academic papers.

It seems like you're discussing the development of a chatbot that mimics the personality and responses of Mr. Beast, a famous YouTuber. The conversation is about training and fine-tuning the chatbot to respond accurately to prompts, and testing its ability to answer questions that are both relevant and unrelated to Mr. Beast's online presence.

To assist with the task you mentioned earlier, I can help extract links from a sources folder and convert them into APA-style citations for academic papers. Please provide the sources folder, and I'll do my best to scrape the links and format them according to the APA citation style.

The output will include both the properly formatted APA reference and the original clickable link. For example:

Author, A. A. (Year). Title of webpage. Website Name. URL (https://example.com/article1)
Author, B. B. (Year). Title of webpage. Website Name. URL (https://example.com/article2)

Please provide the sources folder, and I'll get started on extracting the links and formatting them into APA-style citations.

---

There are no links in the provided text, so there are no APA-style citations to generate. The text appears to be a conversation between a student and Mr. Beast about a chatbot project, along with some analysis of the project's results. If you provide the sources folder with documents containing links, I can assist you in extracting the links and formatting them into APA-style citations.
