How Hackers are Gaining Access to AI Large Language Models

The global adoption of generative AI tools, particularly large language model-based (LLM) chatbots, has led to the emergence of new hacking techniques. These techniques, which do not require programming or IT-specific skills, are similar to social engineering methods. This article explores some of the main tricks used to hack LLMs for malicious purposes.

One such technique is prompt injection, which involves adding specific instructions into a prompt to hijack the model's output for malicious purposes. This technique was first discovered by LLM security company Preamble in early 2022 and later publicized by two data scientists, Riley Goodside and Simon Willison. Goodside demonstrated that he could trick OpenAI's GPT-3 model by adding specific instructions, context, or hints within the prompt into generating harmful or unwanted output. This type of attack resembles an SQL injection, where malicious inputs exploit vulnerabilities.

Another technique is prompt leaking, which forces the model to reveal its prompt. Revealing a language model's internal workings or parameters can be a concern in scenarios where sensitive or confidential information might be exposed through the generated responses, potentially compromising data privacy or security.

Data training poisoning, also known as indirect prompt injection, is a technique used to manipulate or corrupt the training data used to train machine learning models. In this method, an attacker injects malicious or biased data into the training dataset to influence the behavior of the trained model when it encounters similar data in the future. By intentionally poisoning the training data, the attacker aims to exploit vulnerabilities in the model's learning process and induce erroneous or malicious behavior.

Jailbreaking is another technique that specifically applies to chatbots based on LLMs, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard. Jailbreaking a generative AI chatbot refers to using prompt injection to bypass safety and moderation features placed on LLMs by their creators or restrictions imposed on a device's operating system. A wide range of jailbreaking techniques have been demonstrated, many of which have similarities with social engineering techniques. LLM developers regularly update their rules to make known jailbreaking techniques inefficient, but attackers keep inventing novel approaches.

In conclusion, hackers are using various techniques to gain access to AI large language models, including prompt injection, prompt leaking, data training poisoning, and jailbreaking. These techniques can be used for malicious purposes, such as generating harmful or unwanted output, revealing sensitive information, or inducing erroneous behavior. It is essential for LLM developers and users to be aware of these techniques and take measures to prevent them.
