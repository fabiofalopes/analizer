## REQUIREMENTS

- The application must be developed using Flutter for both Android and iOS platforms.

- The project is divided into two parts, with the second part focusing on integrating the application with the EMEL API, data persistence, and geolocation features.

- The application must use dependency injection through the Provider library.

- If local data persistence is implemented, the Sqflite library must be used.

- The application must function on at least API 29 (minSdkVersion cannot be greater than 29).

- The application must include a video demonstrating its functionalities, narrated by the group members.

- The README.md file must include:
  - Group members' names and numbers.
  - Screenshots of the screens.
  - Identification of implemented functionalities.
  - Self-assessment of the project.
  - Description of the application's architecture and best practices used.
  - Link to the video presentation.
  - Description of business logic classes, including attributes and methods.

- A minimum of four non-trivial commits must be made by each group member for the second part of the project.

- The final submission must include a release APK, not a debug version.

- The project must meet all mandatory requirements to pass the evaluation.

## TASKS

- Continue development in the existing repository from part one of the project.

- Integrate the application with the EMEL API using the provided access token.

- Implement data persistence using Sqflite if required.

- Implement geolocation features to find nearby parking spots.

- Create unit and integration tests to ensure the quality of the application.

- Develop a video presentation that demonstrates all implemented functionalities within a maximum duration of 4 minutes.

- Prepare and submit a README.md file with all required information.

- Ensure that all screens are functional, even if using fictitious data for testing purposes.

- Conduct at least four non-trivial commits during development.

- Submit the final APK via Moodle following the specified naming convention.

## CONTEXT

- The project aims to assist drivers in finding available parking spots in Lisbon through an intuitive mobile application interface.

- The first part of the project focused on UI design and navigation, while the second part emphasizes backend integration and data handling.

- Best practices in UI/UX should be followed throughout the development process to enhance user experience.

- The use of environment variables for sensitive information (like API keys) is encouraged to maintain security.

- The application should be designed to handle errors gracefully, especially when dealing with geolocation and API requests.
