It seems like your request got cut off. Could you please provide more details about what you would like the Flutter widget to display? For example, are you looking to display data from a specific API endpoint, such as electric vehicle charging stations, traffic closures, or something else? Additionally, any specific design or functionality requirements would be helpful!
